Write a simple easy to understand cypher query for below requirement.
User node is connected to UserAccount nodes with relationship "HAS_ATTRIBUTE".

I need to find all the UserAccount nodes and check if we have label "UNASSIGNED" or "ASSIGNED".
If its not there, then add label "ASSIGNED" to the UserAccount node.
