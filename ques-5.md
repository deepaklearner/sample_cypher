In this process, can we collect manager name and workemail in batches without using optional match..

1. **Remove `Name` and `WorkEmail` attributes**: Since you've mentioned removing these for now, we will exclude `m` and `w` related to `Name` and `WorkEmail`.

2. **Optimize CASE statements**: Instead of repeating `CASE` for each manager level, we can use `pandas` to simplify the computation logic after fetching the raw data.

3. **Avoiding `OPTIONAL MATCH` for unneeded data**: Instead of collecting all the manager information for every user, we will limit it to just the necessary levels of managers.

Here’s how you can achieve this optimization.

### Optimized Cypher Query (Without `Name` and `WorkEmail`):

```cypher
MATCH (u:User)
WHERE u.managerid IS NOT NULL 
AND ("Employee" IN labels(u) OR "Contractor" IN labels(u))

// Traverse the reporting structure (up to 15 levels)
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*1..15]->(m:User)

WITH u, COLLECT(DISTINCT m.employeeNumber) AS manager_ids

RETURN u.employeeNumber AS employeeid,
    CASE 
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 1 AND u.employeeNumber = manager_ids[0] THEN 1
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 1 AND u.employeeNumber <> manager_ids[0] THEN 2
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 2 THEN 3
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 3 THEN 4
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 4 THEN 5
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 5 THEN 6
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 6 THEN 7
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 7 THEN 8
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 8 THEN 9
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 9 THEN 10
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 10 THEN 11
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 11 THEN 12
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 12 THEN 13
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 13 THEN 14
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 14 THEN 15
        ELSE 16
    END AS Level,

    // Select L1 to L15 manager IDs based on the number of managers
    REDUCE(result = [], i IN RANGE(0, 14) | 
        CASE WHEN i < SIZE(manager_ids) THEN result + [manager_ids[i]] ELSE result END
    ) AS manager_levels

ORDER BY u.employeeNumber
SKIP {offset} LIMIT {batch_size};
```

### Explanation of Key Changes:
1. **No `Name` and `WorkEmail` Attributes**: Removed the optional matches for `Name` and `WorkEmail`.
2. **Manager IDs Only**: Instead of collecting manager details, we just collect `manager_ids` (i.e., employee numbers) to simplify the logic.
3. **Optimized `CASE` and `REDUCE`**: Using the `REDUCE` function, we are efficiently collecting manager IDs for levels L1 to L15.

### Post-Query Processing in Python (Using Pandas):

Once you retrieve the results from the Neo4j query, you can further optimize and process the data using `pandas` to structure the output effectively.

Here’s how you can process the output in Python using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming `data` is the result fetched from Neo4j (as a list of dictionaries)
data = [
    # Example data
    {"employeeid": 1001, "Level": 1, "manager_levels": [2001]},
    {"employeeid": 1002, "Level": 2, "manager_levels": [2001, 3001]},
    {"employeeid": 1003, "Level": 3, "manager_levels": [2001, 3001, 4001]},
]

# Convert to pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Expand the manager levels (L1, L2, ..., L15)
for i in range(15):
    df[f'L{i+1}managerid'] = df['manager_levels'].apply(lambda x: x[i] if i < len(x) else None)

# Drop the intermediate 'manager_levels' column as it's no longer needed
df = df.drop(columns=['manager_levels'])

# Example of how to display the first few rows:
print(df.head())
```

### What the Python Code Does:
1. **Loads Data into `pandas`**: The results from Neo4j are converted into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Expands `manager_levels`**: It creates columns for L1 to L15 based on the number of managers in the `manager_levels` list.
3. **Cleans Up**: Drops the intermediate `manager_levels` column, which is now redundant.

This method ensures that you get a clean and optimized dataset after the query execution, avoiding redundant `CASE` statements and keeping the logic for different manager levels flexible and easily adaptable.

### Further Optimization:
If your organization has a large number of employees and managers, ensure that:
- Your database is indexed on `employeeNumber` or `managerid` for faster traversal.
- Avoid returning more data than necessary (e.g., skip unused levels or managers).
