When backing up large datasets, such as 7 million rows, the operation can become quite resource-intensive and slow if done all at once. To efficiently handle large backups, it's recommended to break the process into smaller chunks or batches. This approach minimizes the load on your database, prevents timeouts, and improves overall performance.

Here’s how you can back up large datasets (7 million rows in your case) effectively:

### Steps for Efficient Backup of Large Datasets:

1. **Use Batching**: Instead of copying all 7 million rows at once, break the operation into smaller batches, like 10,000 or 50,000 rows per batch.
2. **Use Indexing**: Ensure your source table is indexed on the columns that will be used in your `WHERE` clause (e.g., `PrimaryKey`, `ID`, or `CreateTimestamp`) for better performance.
3. **Optimize the `INSERT`**: Use `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` instead of inserting rows one by one for better performance.

### Updated Code for Efficient Backup:

The key part of this solution is breaking the backup into smaller chunks and using a `WHERE` clause to select smaller subsets of rows to back up at a time. I'll assume that the `ID` or `PrimaryKey` column is available for efficient batching.

Here’s how you can modify your function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Connect to MySQL using pymysql
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='yourdb'
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 1: Define the function to backup large data in chunks
def backup_large_data_in_chunks(cursor, table_name, backup_table_name, chunk_size=10000):
    # Step 1.1: Get the primary key or any unique identifier column (e.g., ID)
    cursor.execute(f"DESCRIBE {table_name};")
    columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.fetchall()]
    primary_key = columns[0]  # Assuming the first column is the primary key

    # Step 1.2: Backup in chunks by primary key or another column
    # We'll back up in batches by selecting rows based on the primary key (or other column)
    
    cursor.execute(f"SELECT MIN({primary_key}), MAX({primary_key}) FROM {table_name};")
    min_id, max_id = cursor.fetchone()

    current_id = min_id
    while current_id <= max_id:
        # Step 1.3: Backup a chunk of data based on the primary key range
        next_id = current_id + chunk_size - 1
        backup_query = f"""
        INSERT INTO {backup_table_name}
        SELECT *, NOW() FROM {table_name}
        WHERE {primary_key} BETWEEN {current_id} AND {next_id};
        """
        cursor.execute(backup_query)
        conn.commit()
        print(f"Backed up rows {current_id} to {next_id} to {backup_table_name}.")
        
        current_id = next_id + 1  # Move to the next chunk

# Step 2: Define a function to delete backup data older than 7 days
def delete_old_backup_data(cursor, backup_table_name):
    seven_days_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    delete_query = f"DELETE FROM {backup_table_name} WHERE BackupTimestamp < '{seven_days_ago}'"
    cursor.execute(delete_query)
    conn.commit()
    print(f"Deleted backup data older than 7 days from {backup_table_name}.")

# Step 3: Call the functions to backup large data and delete old backups
backup_large_data_in_chunks(cursor, "your_table", "glidesupervisorhierachy_backup", chunk_size=10000)

# Step 4: Delete old backup data
delete_old_backup_data(cursor, "glidesupervisorhierachy_backup")

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Batched Backup (`backup_large_data_in_chunks`)**:
   - **Primary Key Range**: We select the minimum (`min_id`) and maximum (`max_id`) values of the primary key (or any other unique column). The backup is done in chunks based on this range.
   - **Chunk Size**: The chunk size is configurable (`chunk_size=10000` by default). This means that each batch will back up 10,000 rows at a time.
   - **Inserting Data in Batches**: The `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` query copies a batch of rows (from `current_id` to `next_id`) into the backup table, and then `commit()` is called to ensure the data is saved.
   - **Iterative Process**: The process continues until all rows have been backed up.

2. **Deleting Old Backup Data**:
   - After backing up the data, we delete rows in the `glidesupervisorhierachy_backup` table that are older than 7 days based on the `BackupTimestamp`.
   
3. **Adjustments for Your Setup**:
   - The function assumes you have a primary key column. If you don’t, you can use another indexed column or the `CreateTimestamp` column if that works for batching.
   - You can adjust the chunk size depending on the size of the data and the performance characteristics of your system. A chunk size of 10,000 is a good starting point, but you can experiment with larger or smaller batches.

### Performance Tips:
- **Indexes**: Make sure your `primary_key` column or the column you use for batching is indexed. This will significantly speed up the `WHERE` clause when selecting ranges of data.
- **Bulk Insert**: The `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` method is faster than inserting rows one by one. Ensure you are using this approach for bulk insert.
- **Commit After Each Batch**: Committing after each batch ensures you don’t keep too many changes in memory, and it also reduces the risk of running into timeouts or memory limits.

This method should efficiently handle backing up 7 million rows in chunks without overwhelming your database.
