Thanks for the clarification.

You're asking to **filter rows where the "Terminated" label *is present*** — replacing the previous logic that filtered rows missing "Active" or "OnLeave".

Here’s how you can rewrite the code accordingly:

### ✅ Modified Code:
```python
# New logic: Filter rows where 'Terminated' label IS present
terminated_label = df['labels'].apply(
    lambda labels: any(l == 'Terminated' for l in labels)
)
reject_employment_status_df = df[terminated_label]
```

### 🔍 What This Does:
- `terminated_label` is `True` for rows where `"Terminated"` is found in the `labels` list.
- `reject_employment_status_df` will contain only those rows.

Let me know if you want to handle case-insensitive matches (like `'terminated'`, `'TERMINATED'`, etc.).
