In Neo4j, I am using below cypher to create graph: """
    CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
      "
        MATCH (n:User)
        WHERE n.managerid IS NOT NULL
        RETURN n
      ",
      "
        OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r:REPORTS_TO]->(m:User)
        WHERE n.managerid <> m.employeeNumber
        DELETE r
        WITH n
        MATCH (m:User {employeeNumber: n.managerid})
        MERGE (n)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(m)
      ",
      {batchSize: 10000, parallel: false}
    )"""

Write a very simple cypher, which is easy to debug and easiy to understand for beginners to create a report. employeeNumber matching with managerid is ceo. It should have Level value 1.

Sample report format:

Note: 
1. Dont hardcode ceo logic.
2. Dont use set statement.
3. Keep the solution very simple.
4. Avoid using relationship() function. Dont use "REPORTS_TO*" . Keep the solution very simple and easy to understand.
