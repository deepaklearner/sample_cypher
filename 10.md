Answer:
When you're comparing and updating records for multiple manager columns (such as `L1ManagerAetnaID`, `L1ManagerName`, `L1ManagerJobCode`, etc., for each manager level), you don't necessarily need to compare **all columns** if your goal is to minimize the number of updates and only make changes when necessary. However, the specific columns you choose to compare depend on the nature of your data and what you want to track.

### Key Considerations for Comparing:

1. **Check for Business Requirements**:
   - **Essential columns**: Only compare the columns that **must** be updated when they change (e.g., `L1ManagerAetnaID`, `L1ManagerName`, etc., if the change in manager details needs to reflect in your table).
   - **Unchanged data**: If some columns (such as `email address` or `job code`) are unlikely to change frequently or aren't important to the update operation, you could skip them to reduce comparison time.

2. **Columns That Actually Change**:
   - If you're only concerned with updating manager relationships, focus on columns that directly influence the manager hierarchy or structure. For example, you might care more about the manager IDs (`L1ManagerAetnaID`, `L2ManagerAetnaID`, etc.) than about names or job codes.
   - If the job codes or names are only auxiliary information that doesn't affect the hierarchy, then you might not need to compare them unless there’s a business need to do so.

3. **Optimizing Performance**:
   - **Fewer comparisons = faster execution**: Comparing fewer columns means less computation and therefore better performance. You could start by comparing just the `ManagerID` columns (e.g., `L1ManagerAetnaID`, `L2ManagerAetnaID`) and only extend to other columns (e.g., `name`, `job code`, etc.) if those columns need to be part of the update logic.
   - **Change detection strategy**: For each manager level (`L1`, `L2`, etc.), if you are updating manager-related details, only compare the `ManagerID` (and other relevant fields) for changes before updating the database.

### Step-by-Step Comparison Approach:

1. **Identify Key Columns**:
   If the changes are mostly related to managers, you can start by comparing the manager ID fields like:
   - `L1ManagerAetnaID`, `L2ManagerAetnaID`, ..., `L15ManagerAetnaID`

2. **Evaluate Which Other Columns are Critical**:
   After determining if the manager IDs have changed, decide if you need to check other columns for changes (e.g., `name`, `job code`, `email address`). For example:
   - If a `ManagerAetnaID` changes, but the `name` or `job code` does not, you might not need to update those fields unless required by your business logic.
   
3. **Compare Efficiently**:
   Instead of comparing all 6 columns (for each ManagerID), you can:
   - **First**: Compare only the key fields that affect the manager assignment (like `ManagerAetnaID`).
   - **Second**: For the rows where changes are detected in the manager-related fields, you can compare the rest of the columns (name, job code, etc.) if needed.

4. **Only Update if Necessary**:
   Once the changes are identified, perform the update only for rows where the values have actually changed, minimizing unnecessary updates.

### Example:

Let’s assume your `identities` table has columns for multiple manager details like `L1ManagerAetnaID`, `L1ManagerName`, `L1ManagerJobCode`, etc., and you are comparing them with a new DataFrame. You might do something like:

```python
# Assume df_new contains the new data with manager info
# We want to compare the AetnaIDs first and then check other columns (if needed)

# Check changes for ManagerID columns (e.g., L1ManagerAetnaID to L15ManagerAetnaID)
manager_columns = ['L1ManagerAetnaID', 'L2ManagerAetnaID', ..., 'L15ManagerAetnaID']

# Identify rows where any of the ManagerIDs have changed
changed_manager_rows = (existing_data[manager_columns] != df_new[manager_columns]).any(axis=1)

# Filter rows where managers have changed
df_changed_managers = df_new[changed_manager_rows]

# Compare other columns like Name, Job Code, etc. for only those rows that have manager changes
for index, row in df_changed_managers.iterrows():
    update_query = f"""
    UPDATE identities
    SET L1ManagerAetnaID = {row['L1ManagerAetnaID']}, 
        L1ManagerName = '{row['L1ManagerName']}',
        L1ManagerJobCode = '{row['L1ManagerJobCode']}',
        ... 
    WHERE employeeid = {row['employeeid']}
    """
    # Execute update queries
```

### Key Points:
- **Start with comparing just the `ManagerID` fields**. These are the most important for identifying a change in manager structure.
- **Extend the comparison** to other columns (like `name`, `job code`, etc.) only if needed (e.g., if a manager's name or job code has changed).
- **Batch the updates** for improved performance (i.e., updating only the rows that have changes).

### Final Recommendation:
For performance reasons, **start by comparing just the manager-related columns** (like `L1ManagerAetnaID`, `L1ManagerName`, etc.). If there are changes, then proceed to update the corresponding columns for each manager level. If a change in a manager column necessitates an update to other fields (e.g., `name` or `job code`), then compare and update those fields as well.
