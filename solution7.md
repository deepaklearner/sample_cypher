i want to send email to managers for existing_warned and existing_rejected if they have some data. Also, i want to have two different templates for rejection and warning. 

also i want to group the managers email from the file and send to them and keep techops team in cc. if manager email is not there, then send email only to techops team.

this code is running batches, i want to append existing_warned and existing_rejected data for every batch.
And then send email as attachment to the manager which is present in the last column in df
