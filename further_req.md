1.0.
I am told to write a csv report to a sql table as well for .7 million rows using python.
I already have code to write the data from pandas df to csv.

Connect to the MySQL database using pymysql.connect
How should i plan? Should i delete everything and write fresh in batches?

1.1.
i have so many columns and most of them are same the column name in pandas dataframe except 2 of them

1.2.
there is one column which is ManagerLevel in datafarme and level in table
How should i plan? Should i delete everything and write fresh in batches?

2.
Requirement to code in python """

Update table glide.iamidsidentities in mysql db. Find the record based on primary key user id (resourceid), and update only those records and only columns that i have in my dataframe. Leave the other columns as it is with no change in data.
"""
2.1 i have huge data .7 million
2.2 can we avoid iterrows
3. If the resourceid is present in df but not present in iamidsidentities. print those resourceid in form of a list in the log for the batch.
3.1 Give me full code
3.2 glide.iamidsidentities is a huge table having .7 million rows. i dont think "SELECT resourceid FROM glide.iamidsidentities" is a good idea

4. In 1.2 solution, I want to separate the delete data from table logic in a separate function bkp_tbl_n_delete_data. Take backup in table glidesupervisorhierachy_backup. I want to retain the data for 7 days only in backup table. Make use of column CreateTimestamp.

4.1 How to backup .7 million rows.
4.2 when writing data to backup table. also add a new column BackupTimestamp.
The column BackupTimestamp is not present in original table. This will exist only in backup table.
Populate the value from python and pass it to db.


5. This is my code
5.1 How can i make my code easy to maintain. 
5.2 gpt missed to add below code:
"with open(report_output_file_with_timestamp, "w", newline='') as csvfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    header_written = False

    if iam_graph_operations:
        backup_success = iam_data_export_glide.backup_table_data(
            table_name="glide.glidesupervisorhierarchy",
            backup_table_name="glide.glidesupervisorhierarchy_backup"
        )
        
        if backup_success:
            iam_data_export_glide.del_7days_old_data(
                backup_table_name="glide.glidesupervisorhierarchy_backup",
                chunk_size=chunk_size
            )
            iam_data_export_glide.del_data_frm_table(
                table_name="glide.glidesupervisorhierarchy",
                chunk_size=chunk_size
            )
            flag_success = True
        else:
            logging.info("Backup failed, skipping deletion of old data")
            flag_success = False"

5.3. where is "iam_data_export_glide.close_connections()"

6. mysql db operations code 
6.1 How can i make my code easy to maintain. 
6.2 where is executemany?
6.3 where is rollback in update_data_to_identities
6.4 where is logic for missing_resource_ids

6.5 i am getting error in this line """ data_to_update = [(tuple([row[idx] for idx in req_columns] + [row['resourceid']])) for row in batch.values]""" error fetching data: only intezers, slices (':', ellipses, numpy.newaxis, None and or boolean arrays are valid indices

7. code for identities update
7.1. How can i make my code easy to maintain. 

8. I am running function update_data_to_identities on .7 million rows. And its running very slow. How can we optimize it. Also, there are lot of records which are not missing. so missing_resource_ids dataframe is very large. Please suggest optimize ideas.

8.1 by deepseek
8.2 can you please rename existing_resource_ids with glide_resource_ids and all_resource_ids to graphdb_resource_ids

9. code of populate supervisor hierachy
9.1 How can i make my code easy to maintain. 
9.2 can we move match_user_qry  and match_user_without_mngr_qry  also to helper function
9.3 or better i am thinking if we can move them to a yaml config file. what do you suggest

10. in 8.2 code
i have a mysql table identities, it has employeeid, L1Managerid, L2Managerid upto L15Managerid... There is another pandas dataframe. I have to update multiple columns in table identities, if there is a change in L1Managerid, L2Managerid upto L15Managerid columns. the primary key is employeeid. The total number of records is 1 million. As of now I am updating the whole table. is there any better optimized way

i have a mysql table identities, it has resourceid with employeeid, L1Managerid, L2Managerid upto L15Managerid... There is another pandas dataframe. I have to update multiple columns in table identities, if there is a change in L1Managerid, L2Managerid upto L15Managerid columns. the primary key is employeeid. The total number of records is 1 million. I want to identify the rows which are eligible for update by comparing employeeid, L1Managerid, L2Managerid upto L15Managerid etc

11.2 can we create a dictionary for new_managers as well like current_manager_data. I think that would be safer approach

12. code with ques
once we identify the rows to update for change is manager data for any of the columns, we will update all the columns in req_columns as mentioned in my question for the source dataframe into the table 

in glide database the column employeeid column is named as resourceid.
also to avoid confusion, please rename existing_data_query to glide_data_query and others similarly.

In df, we have EmployeeID.

we also have to log missing EmployeeID in glide database.

got error here ... Error updating data: Item wrong length 15 instead of 4 at this line """change_mask = merged_df[[f'{col}_new' != f'{col}_old' for col in manager_columns]].any(axis=1)"""

at line """req_columns = df.columns.tolist()  # Assuming all columns in df are required for update""" update column name "EmployeeID" to "resourceid" to match with column name in glide database
