To make the code easier to **read, maintain, test, and scale**, consider refactoring it using principles of **modularization**, **separation of concerns**, and **single-responsibility**. Here's a breakdown of improvements you can make:

---

### ✅ **1. High-Level Structure: Break into Methods or Classes**

Split the logic into **clearly named methods** that encapsulate steps like reading data, processing it, writing reports, etc. Here's a suggested structure:

```python
def create_graph_for_entitlements(self):
    try:
        with IAMGraphCreation(self.database_config) as iam_create_graph:
            self._initialize_batch_state()

            while True:
                entitlements_edw = self._fetch_batch(batch_counter, offset)
                if entitlements_edw.empty:
                    break

                entitlements_neo4j = self._fetch_from_neo4j(iam_create_graph, entitlements_edw)
                new_entitlements, updated_entitlements = self._identify_new_and_updated(entitlements_edw, entitlements_neo4j)

                self._create_and_update_nodes(iam_create_graph, new_entitlements, updated_entitlements, feature_name)

                delta_entitlements = pd.concat([new_entitlements, updated_entitlements])
                if not delta_entitlements.empty:
                    self._process_entitlement_owners(iam_create_graph, delta_entitlements, feature_name)

                self._update_counters()
            
            self._write_final_reports()

    except Exception as e:
        self._log_error(e)
    finally:
        entitlement_ingestion.close_connections()
    return True
```

---

### ✅ **2. Suggested Method Responsibilities**

Here are logical helper methods you can extract from the current monolith:

* `_initialize_batch_state()`: Sets up counters, offsets, empty DataFrames.
* `_fetch_batch(batch_counter, offset)`: Fetches entitlements from EDW.
* `_fetch_from_neo4j(graph, edw_df)`: Fetches entitlement data from Neo4j.
* `_identify_new_and_updated(edw_df, neo4j_df)`: Deduces new and updated entitlements.
* `_create_and_update_nodes(graph, new_df, updated_df, feature_name)`: Calls graph creation/updating functions.
* `_process_entitlement_owners(graph, entitlements_df, feature_name)`: Enriches, validates owners, logs warnings/errors.
* `_write_final_reports()`: Concatenates and writes reports.
* `_update_counters()`: Increments offset and batch count.
* `_log_error(e)`: Logs structured error messages.

---

### ✅ **3. Utility / Support Classes**

You may also split these into **separate service classes** for:

* **EDW fetching logic** → `EntitlementDataFetcher`
* **Neo4j interaction logic** → already in `IAMGraphCreation`
* **Report generation** → `EntitlementReportWriter`
* **Enrichment logic** → `OwnerEnricher` or similar

This allows testable, composable components.

---

### ✅ **4. Logging Enhancements**

Wrap logs in helper methods for consistent formatting, or consider structured logging:

```python
def log_df_info(df, label):
    if df.empty:
        logging.info(f"{label}: DataFrame is empty")
    else:
        logging.info(f"{label} (rows: {len(df)}):\n{df.to_string()}")
```

---

### ✅ **5. Constants & Configs**

Extract magic strings or repeated params like `['entitlementName', 'targetSystem']` or `['owner1', 'owner2', 'owner3']` into constants at the top of the class/module.

---

### ✅ **6. Functional Decomposition if Class Overhead Isn't Needed**

If this is script-like and doesn't belong to a large class, you can still break this down into independent functions and just pass `feature_name`, config, etc., explicitly.

---

### ✅ Final Result: Cleaner Flow

The final refactored flow would be something like:

```python
def create_graph_for_entitlements(self):
    try:
        with IAMGraphCreation(self.database_config) as graph:
            self._initialize()
            while batch_data := self._fetch_batch():
                self._process_batch(graph, batch_data)
            self._write_reports()
    except Exception as e:
        self._handle_error(e)
    finally:
        entitlement_ingestion.close_connections()
    return True
```

---

Would you like me to help **start rewriting** the actual code with this refactoring in place?
