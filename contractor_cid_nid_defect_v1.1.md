Using python, if i am reading a dataframe from csv and then using a for loop and passing that dataframe to different classes.
In one of the class method, I want to add a new column to a dataframe. 

If the first for loop, that dataframe is passed to next iteration, how can i retain that new column and access it later.

Q. how to add a new column in pandas dataframe 


Q. In this code I want to add a flag as a new column in the dataframe with value Y, where combined_filter when its True
