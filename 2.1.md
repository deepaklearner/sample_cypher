Great question! ðŸ‘Œ

If you're calling `sys.exit()`, you **should call `tracemalloc.stop()` _before_ `sys.exit()`**, because once `sys.exit()` runs, Python begins shutting down the interpreter, and anything after it wonâ€™t be executed â€” including cleanup like `tracemalloc.stop()`.

### Correct Usage:

```python
import tracemalloc
import sys

tracemalloc.start()

# Your code here

# Cleanup before exiting
tracemalloc.stop()

sys.exit(0)  # or sys.exit(1)
```

### Why it matters:
- `tracemalloc.stop()` disables tracking and frees resources.
- If you place `sys.exit()` first, `tracemalloc.stop()` is **skipped**, and you might leave tracking on unnecessarily (especially bad in long-running or embedded systems).

If youâ€™re doing more cleanup, like closing files or releasing resources, always do that **before** `sys.exit()`.
