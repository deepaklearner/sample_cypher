Yes — **that's the better approach**: create a **common retry wrapper** function to handle retries for all your database fetch methods.

This avoids copy-pasting retry logic in every method and gives you:

* ✅ Centralized control over retry behavior (max attempts, backoff, logging)
* ✅ Cleaner, more maintainable code
* ✅ Easier to apply retries consistently across all DB operations

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step: Create a Common Retry Decorator

#### 1. **Add this method inside your `IAMDataIngestion` class:**

```python
def retry_db_operation(self, operation, *args, max_retries=3, **kwargs):
    attempt = 0
    while attempt < max_retries:
        try:
            if not self.edw_connection or not self.is_connection_alive():
                self.reconnect()
            return operation(*args, **kwargs)

        except (pymysql.err.OperationalError, pymysql.err.InterfaceError) as e:
            attempt += 1
            logging.warning(f"Retry {attempt}/{max_retries} for {operation.__name__}: {str(e)}")
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
            self.reconnect()

        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Unrecoverable error in {operation.__name__}: {str(e)}")
            break

    logging.error(f"All {max_retries} attempts failed for {operation.__name__}")
    return pd.DataFrame()
```

---

#### 2. **Use it like this in your methods:**

Replace this code:

```python
query = self.sql_qrys['edw_query'][sql_query_param].format(placeholders=placeholders)
return pd.read_sql(query, con=self.edw_connection, params=keys)
```

With:

```python
def _execute_query(self, query, params=None):
    return pd.read_sql(query, con=self.edw_connection, params=params)

query = self.sql_qrys['edw_query'][sql_query_param].format(placeholders=placeholders)
return self.retry_db_operation(self._execute_query, query, params=keys)
```

You can do the same for batch and full fetches by passing different query strings and params.

---

### 🧼 Optional: make `_execute_query()` a **static method** if you don't need access to `self`.

### 🔁 Summary of Benefits

| ✅ Centralized Retry Logic  | All methods reuse the same pattern |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 📉 Less Code Duplication   | Fewer chances of mistakes          |
| 🧪 Easier to Test & Adjust | Tweak retries/backoff in one place |
| ⚙️ Works with Any Query    | Just pass in a function + args     |

Would you like me to fully refactor one of your methods (e.g. `fetch_data_from_eservice_data`) using this common retry wrapper as a concrete example?
