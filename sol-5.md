Yes, you can collect manager names and work emails in batches without relying on `OPTIONAL MATCH` by adjusting the way you structure your Cypher query. Here's how you can achieve that while still optimizing for performance and batching the results:

### Key Adjustments:

1. **Remove `OPTIONAL MATCH` for unnecessary data**: Instead of collecting manager names or work emails upfront, we can collect the manager IDs and then use separate queries or processing steps to gather detailed information about the managers.

2. **Batching**: We will continue to use batching to control how many results are processed at once. This helps in handling large datasets efficiently without hitting memory or performance issues.

3. **Efficient Data Collection**: The idea is to fetch only the necessary data (e.g., manager IDs), which simplifies the query and minimizes unnecessary computation.

### Optimized Cypher Query (Without `OPTIONAL MATCH` for Names/Emails):

```cypher
MATCH (u:User)
WHERE u.managerid IS NOT NULL 
AND ("Employee" IN labels(u) OR "Contractor" IN labels(u))

// Traverse the reporting structure (up to 15 levels)
MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*1..15]->(m:User)

// Collect manager employee numbers
WITH u, COLLECT(DISTINCT m.employeeNumber) AS manager_ids

RETURN u.employeeNumber AS employeeid,
    CASE 
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 1 AND u.employeeNumber = manager_ids[0] THEN 1
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 1 AND u.employeeNumber <> manager_ids[0] THEN 2
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 2 THEN 3
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 3 THEN 4
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 4 THEN 5
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 5 THEN 6
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 6 THEN 7
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 7 THEN 8
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 8 THEN 9
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 9 THEN 10
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 10 THEN 11
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 11 THEN 12
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 12 THEN 13
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 13 THEN 14
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 14 THEN 15
        ELSE 16
    END AS Level,

    // Select L1 to L15 manager IDs based on the number of managers
    REDUCE(result = [], i IN RANGE(0, 14) | 
        CASE WHEN i < SIZE(manager_ids) THEN result + [manager_ids[i]] ELSE result END
    ) AS manager_levels

ORDER BY u.employeeNumber
SKIP {offset} LIMIT {batch_size};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Manager ID Collection**: We only collect `employeeNumber` for each manager in the reporting hierarchy (up to 15 levels). This avoids unnecessary data retrieval and keeps the query light.
2. **Manager Levels**: The `REDUCE` function is used to efficiently build the list of manager IDs (`manager_levels`) for each employee. This structure holds the IDs for the L1 to L15 managers.
3. **No Optional Matches for Names/Emails**: By focusing only on employee numbers, the query avoids the overhead of retrieving unnecessary attributes (e.g., manager names or emails) during the traversal.

### Post-Query Processing in Python (`pandas`):

After retrieving the query results, you can use Python and `pandas` to fetch additional manager details (like names or work emails) in separate batches.

```python
import pandas as pd
import neo4j

# Assuming `data` is the result fetched from Neo4j (list of dictionaries)
data = [
    # Example data
    {"employeeid": 1001, "Level": 1, "manager_levels": [2001]},
    {"employeeid": 1002, "Level": 2, "manager_levels": [2001, 3001]},
    {"employeeid": 1003, "Level": 3, "manager_levels": [2001, 3001, 4001]},
]

# Convert to pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Expand the manager levels (L1, L2, ..., L15)
for i in range(15):
    df[f'L{i+1}managerid'] = df['manager_levels'].apply(lambda x: x[i] if i < len(x) else None)

# Drop the intermediate 'manager_levels' column as it's no longer needed
df = df.drop(columns=['manager_levels'])

# Example of how to display the first few rows:
print(df.head())

# Now, query manager names and work emails (separate query):
manager_ids = df[['L1managerid', 'L2managerid', 'L3managerid', 'L4managerid', 'L5managerid']].values.flatten()
manager_ids = [id for id in manager_ids if id is not None]

# Assuming you have a Neo4j connection to fetch manager details:
query = """
MATCH (m:User)
WHERE m.employeeNumber IN $manager_ids
RETURN m.employeeNumber AS employeeid, m.name AS manager_name, m.workEmail AS manager_email
"""
# Neo4j execution (example)
results = neo4j_session.run(query, manager_ids=manager_ids)
manager_data = [record.data() for record in results]

# Convert to pandas DataFrame for easy processing
manager_df = pd.DataFrame(manager_data)

# Merge manager details with the original employee data
final_df = df.merge(manager_df, how='left', left_on='L1managerid', right_on='employeeid', suffixes=('', '_L1'))
print(final_df.head())
```

### Explanation of Post-Processing:
1. **Extract Manager IDs**: After the Cypher query retrieves the employee-manager data, the `manager_levels` column is expanded into separate columns (L1 to L15). This allows for easy extraction of manager IDs.
2. **Query for Manager Names/Emails**: You can then run another query to fetch manager names and work emails using the manager IDs you obtained from the first query.
3. **Merging**: The result of the second query (containing manager names and emails) is merged with the original employee data based on the manager ID columns (`L1managerid`, `L2managerid`, etc.).

### Final Thoughts:
- **Performance Considerations**: Since manager details are fetched in a second step, you reduce the complexity of the initial query and avoid unnecessary data retrieval during the hierarchy traversal.
- **Flexibility**: This approach allows you to easily adapt the query if you need additional manager information or different levels of detail.
