Modify the cypher for Neo4j to have the FirstName and LastName from Name node as well in the RETURN which is connected with User Node with (u:User)-[:HAS_ATTRIBUTE]->(:Name). givenName property will be FirstName and familyName property can become LastName.

NOTE: 
1. 
2. Add first name and last name in the managers list only along with manager employeeNumber like:
   {empid:employeeNumber, fname:n.givenName,lname:n.familyName}
3. Also, i want to have them in a new column in return as L1managerFirstName, L1managerLastName
