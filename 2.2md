Yes, we can avoid using `iterrows()` for efficiency. While `iterrows()` is easy to use, it is not the most efficient way to iterate over rows in a DataFrame, especially for large datasets, because it operates row by row, which can be slow.

Instead, we can take advantage of vectorized operations in Pandas and batch processing directly with Numpy arrays. This will allow us to prepare the data for the `UPDATE` statement more efficiently.

### Revised Approach without `iterrows()`

Here’s an optimized approach where we avoid using `iterrows()`:

1. **Use Numpy to prepare data efficiently**: Instead of iterating through rows, we can use Numpy arrays to select the columns that need to be updated and then prepare the data in one go.

2. **Batch Processing**: We'll process the data in chunks, which is important when working with large datasets.

### Updated Code:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
import numpy as np

# Connect to MySQL using pymysql
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='yourdb'
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 1: Get the column names from your MySQL table (ensure the correct order)
cursor.execute("DESCRIBE glide.iamidsidentities;")
table_columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.fetchall()]

# Step 2: Create a column mapping to handle the name mismatch (ManagerLevel → level)
column_mapping = {
    'ManagerLevel': 'level',  # Map 'ManagerLevel' in DataFrame to 'level' in MySQL
}

# Assuming df is already loaded, you would still need to rename columns
df.rename(columns=column_mapping, inplace=True)

# Step 3: Check if the DataFrame columns exist in the MySQL table
df_columns = df.columns.tolist()
valid_columns = [col for col in df_columns if col in table_columns]

# Step 4: Create the SQL UPDATE statement template
update_query_template = """
    UPDATE glide.iamidsidentities 
    SET {set_clause} 
    WHERE resourceid = %s;
"""

# Prepare the set clause based on valid columns in the DataFrame
set_clause = ', '.join([f"{col} = %s" for col in valid_columns])

# Step 5: Update records in batches
batch_size = 10000  # Adjust batch size for large data, based on server capabilities
batch_counter = 0

# Prepare Numpy arrays for faster operations
valid_columns_idx = [df.columns.get_loc(col) for col in valid_columns]  # Get column indices for valid columns
resourceid_idx = df.columns.get_loc('resourceid')  # Assuming 'resourceid' is in the DataFrame

# Process the data in chunks from the DataFrame (streaming approach)
for start in range(0, len(df), batch_size):
    end = start + batch_size
    batch = df.iloc[start:end]

    # Prepare the data to update, adding resourceid as the last element in each tuple
    batch_values = batch.values  # Convert the DataFrame chunk into a Numpy array

    # Select the relevant data for valid columns (ignoring the columns that are not valid)
    data_to_update = []
    for row in batch_values:
        row_data = [row[idx] for idx in valid_columns_idx]
        resource_id = row[resourceid_idx]  # Get the resourceid for the WHERE clause
        data_to_update.append(tuple(row_data + [resource_id]))

    # Execute the update query for the current batch
    try:
        for data in data_to_update:
            update_query = update_query_template.format(set_clause=set_clause)
            cursor.execute(update_query, data)
        conn.commit()  # Commit after processing the batch
        batch_counter += 1
        print(f"Processed batch {batch_counter}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing batch {batch_counter}: {e}")
        conn.rollback()  # Rollback if something goes wrong with the batch

# Close the cursor and connection after processing all batches
cursor.close()
conn.close()

print(f"Finished processing all {len(df)} records.")
```

### Key Improvements:

1. **Avoiding `iterrows()`**: 
   - We avoid `iterrows()` by directly converting the DataFrame chunk (`batch`) into a Numpy array with `batch.values`. This is far more efficient when working with large datasets.
   
2. **Column Indexing**: 
   - We use `df.columns.get_loc(col)` to get the index of the columns in the DataFrame, which allows us to directly access the relevant values in each row without using the slower `iterrows()` method.

3. **Batching with Numpy**:
   - By using Numpy’s efficient indexing, we can quickly extract the relevant columns (valid columns and `resourceid`) for each row in the batch.

4. **Memory Efficiency**:
   - The batch is processed in chunks (of size `batch_size`), ensuring that we don’t run out of memory, even with 7 million rows of data.

### Additional Optimizations:
- **Parallel Execution**: If your MySQL server can handle multiple connections, you might consider running multiple batches in parallel (e.g., using `concurrent.futures` or threading).
  
- **Database Load Tuning**: Ensure your MySQL configuration is optimized for large batch updates. This includes increasing `innodb_buffer_pool_size` and possibly turning off some non-critical indexes during bulk updates (then rebuilding them afterward).

This method should be much more efficient than using `iterrows()` and should handle 7 million rows without running into memory issues or significant slowdowns.
