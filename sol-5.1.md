You're absolutely right. Fetching details for individual `employeeNumber`s one by one would indeed be slower and less efficient, especially when dealing with a large number of records. Instead, you can query multiple employee numbers at once in a single batch, which is far more efficient.

### Here's a refined approach to fetch manager details for multiple `employeeNumber`s in one go:

### 1. **Fetch Manager Details for Multiple Employees in One Query:**
   You can modify your Cypher query to fetch manager details for multiple employees by leveraging the `IN` operator. This allows you to fetch the manager information for all employees in one go, rather than fetching them one at a time.

For example, if you already have the list of `employeeNumber`s from the initial query or application logic, you can query them all in one batch as follows:

### Optimized Cypher Query:
```cypher
MATCH (u:User)
WHERE u.managerid IS NOT NULL 
AND ("Employee" IN labels(u) OR "Contractor" IN labels(u))

// Traverse the reporting structure (up to 15 levels)
MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*1..15]->(m:User)

// Collect manager employee numbers
WITH u, COLLECT(DISTINCT m.employeeNumber) AS manager_ids

RETURN u.employeeNumber AS employeeid,
    CASE 
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 1 AND u.employeeNumber = manager_ids[0] THEN 1
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 1 AND u.employeeNumber <> manager_ids[0] THEN 2
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 2 THEN 3
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 3 THEN 4
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 4 THEN 5
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 5 THEN 6
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 6 THEN 7
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 7 THEN 8
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 8 THEN 9
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 9 THEN 10
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 10 THEN 11
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 11 THEN 12
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 12 THEN 13
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 13 THEN 14
        WHEN SIZE(manager_ids) = 14 THEN 15
        ELSE 16
    END AS Level,

    // Select L1 to L15 manager IDs based on the number of managers
    REDUCE(result = [], i IN RANGE(0, 14) | 
        CASE WHEN i < SIZE(manager_ids) THEN result + [manager_ids[i]] ELSE result END
    ) AS manager_levels

ORDER BY u.employeeNumber;
```

### Key Points of the Query:
- This query collects **manager IDs** up to 15 levels deep for each employee.
- The results are aggregated in one go using `COLLECT(DISTINCT m.employeeNumber)`.
- For each employee, it calculates their manager levels (L1, L2, ..., L15) without fetching individual manager details in separate queries.

### 2. **Fetching Manager Details for Multiple Employees (Manager Names & Emails)**:
Once you have the list of manager IDs from the first query, you can fetch the manager details (name, email, etc.) in a **single query** for all the managers at once using the `IN` operator. This avoids multiple round trips to the database.

#### Step 1: Get the Manager IDs (from the above query result)
Let's assume you now have a list of manager IDs (from `manager_ids`). You can fetch their details in one go using a query like this:

```cypher
MATCH (m:User)
WHERE m.employeeNumber IN $manager_ids
RETURN m.employeeNumber AS employeeid, m.name AS manager_name, m.workEmail AS manager_email
```

#### Example of How You Could Process This in Python:
```python
# Assuming you have a list of manager_ids obtained from the first query
manager_ids = [2001, 3001, 4001, 5001]  # Example list of manager employee numbers

# Use this list to fetch all manager details at once
query = """
MATCH (m:User)
WHERE m.employeeNumber IN $manager_ids
RETURN m.employeeNumber AS employeeid, m.name AS manager_name, m.workEmail AS manager_email
"""

# Assuming you are using the Neo4j Python driver to execute this query:
results = neo4j_session.run(query, manager_ids=manager_ids)

# Collect the results
manager_data = [record.data() for record in results]

# Convert the result to a pandas DataFrame
import pandas as pd
manager_df = pd.DataFrame(manager_data)

# Now merge this data back with the initial employee data to get the full dataset
# Assuming `df` is your DataFrame containing employees' manager levels
df = df.merge(manager_df, how='left', left_on='L1managerid', right_on='employeeid', suffixes=('', '_L1'))

# Example of viewing the result
print(df.head())
```

### Explanation:
- **Fetch Manager Data in Bulk**: The key improvement here is that you use the `IN` clause to query all the manager details in a single go, rather than making separate requests for each manager.
- **Efficient Manager Level Merging**: After obtaining the manager data, you merge it back with the employee-level data based on the `managerid` fields (L1, L2, etc.). This allows you to efficiently combine the hierarchical structure with the manager details like names and emails.

### 3. **Advantages of This Approach**:
- **Reduced Number of Queries**: Instead of fetching manager details for each `employeeNumber` individually, you fetch them in bulk, which significantly reduces the overhead and number of queries.
- **Efficiency**: Using the `IN` operator to fetch multiple manager details at once reduces round-trip time and database load.
- **Flexibility**: You can adjust the batch size for querying `manager_ids` based on your system’s capacity (e.g., fetching in chunks of 1000 or 5000 manager IDs at a time if needed).

### 4. **Performance Considerations**:
- **Indexes**: Ensure you have indexes on `employeeNumber` and `managerid` to make these queries run efficiently.
- **Query Profiling**: Use Neo4j’s `PROFILE` command to test how your queries perform, especially when working with larger datasets.
- **Batch Size**: You may want to test different batch sizes for `manager_ids`. Too large of a batch might slow down the query, while too small might increase overhead from multiple queries. A reasonable size like 1000 or 5000 items per batch should be effective for most cases.

### 5. **Final Thoughts**:
- **One Query for Employees**: The first query (which collects manager IDs) retrieves data for all employees in a single query, avoiding the need for pagination or multiple queries.
- **One Query for Managers**: The second query retrieves the manager details for all those managers in bulk, again minimizing the number of queries.
- **Optimizing for Large Datasets**: If the list of `manager_ids` is too large (say, millions of IDs), you could still consider breaking it into smaller chunks but within the same batch query strategy.

This approach should provide an optimal balance between query efficiency and minimizing database load, especially when handling large sets of employee-manager relationships.
