To split the query and run it in batches more efficiently, you can break down the process into distinct steps: 

1. **Identify the nodes that need to be processed**.
2. **Delete the mismatched relationships** for each batch of nodes.
3. **Create the correct `REPORTS_TO` relationships** for each batch.

By splitting the query into smaller parts, you can avoid overwhelming the database, reduce transaction time, and potentially handle larger data sets more gracefully. Here's how you can approach it step by step.

### 1. **Step 1: Identify Users with `managerid` to Process**
We first need to identify the set of users whose `managerid` is non-null and matches certain criteria, and then process them in batches. This part can be done in two phases: one for deletion, and another for relationship creation.

### 2. **Step 2: Deleting Mismatched Relationships**
We'll use `apoc.periodic.iterate` to delete the existing relationships (`REPORTS_TO`) for each user in batches, based on the mismatch conditions for `managerid`.

### 3. **Step 3: Creating Correct Relationships**
Once we've handled the deletions, we can create new `REPORTS_TO` relationships based on the correct `managerid`.

### Batching the Process

Hereâ€™s how we can break the original query into smaller, batch-friendly chunks:

#### **Step 1: Batch Users Identification**

You first want to split the user set into smaller batches to process them in chunks. This part will simply fetch users whose `managerid` is non-null, and based on the labels 'Employee' or 'Contractors'.

```cypher
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
    "
    MATCH (n:User)
    WHERE n.managerid IS NOT NULL 
      AND ('Employee' IN labels(n) OR 'Contractors' IN labels(n))
    RETURN n
    ",
    "
    // Step 2: Delete mismatched REPORTS_TO relationships
    OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r:REPORTS_TO]->(m:User)
    WHERE 
        (NOT TOUPPER(n.managerid) STARTS WITH 'A' AND n.managerid <> m.employeeNumber)
        OR (TOUPPER(n.managerid) STARTS WITH 'A' AND n.managerid <> m.aetnaresourceid)
    DELETE r
    ",
    {batchSize: 1000, parallel: true}
);
```

- **Explanation**: 
    - The query selects all users that need to be processed (i.e., those with a non-null `managerid` and labels `'Employee'` or `'Contractors'`).
    - The `apoc.periodic.iterate` function is used to process users in batches of `1000`. Each batch will execute the logic to delete mismatched `REPORTS_TO` relationships.

#### **Step 2: Create New Relationships in Batches**

After deleting the mismatched relationships, we can proceed to create the correct `REPORTS_TO` relationships. This is another step we can break into a batch process.

```cypher
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
    "
    MATCH (n:User)
    WHERE n.managerid IS NOT NULL 
      AND ('Employee' IN labels(n) OR 'Contractors' IN labels(n))
    RETURN n
    ",
    "
    // Step 3: Create new REPORTS_TO relationships based on managerid
    WITH n,
         CASE 
            WHEN TOUPPER(n.managerid) STARTS WITH 'A' THEN 'aetna'
            ELSE 'other'
         END AS managerid_type
    OPTIONAL MATCH (m:User)
    WHERE
        CASE managerid_type
            WHEN 'other' THEN m.employeeNumber = n.managerid
            WHEN 'aetna' THEN m.aetnaresourceid = n.managerid
        END
    FOREACH (_ IN CASE WHEN m IS NOT NULL THEN [1] ELSE [] END |
        MERGE (n)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(m)
    )
    ",
    {batchSize: 1000, parallel: true}
);
```

- **Explanation**: 
    - This second part does the creation of the correct `REPORTS_TO` relationships. After identifying the correct manager (`m`), the relationship is created.
    - The batch size is kept to `1000`, and `parallel: true` is used to process batches concurrently, which can significantly improve speed depending on your hardware and Neo4j configuration.

### How Does This Work in Batches?

- **Batch 1: Identify users**: You identify a batch of users based on the query and return them for processing.
- **Batch 2: Delete old relationships**: For each batch, you delete the `REPORTS_TO` relationships where the `managerid` doesn't match the conditions.
- **Batch 3: Create new relationships**: You match the correct managers based on the `managerid` and then create the correct relationships.

This is split into smaller queries using `apoc.periodic.iterate` to handle the batches efficiently. You control the size of the batches with the `batchSize` parameter.

### Adjusting the `batchSize` and Parallelism

- **Small Batch Sizes**: If you have a very large graph and you experience timeouts or the system is under heavy load, reduce the batch size to a smaller number (e.g., 500, 100). This will reduce the memory usage per batch and may help with stability.
  
- **Parallelism**: Setting `parallel: true` can speed up the execution significantly by allowing multiple transactions to run concurrently. However, if the database is under heavy load or the system resources are limited, setting `parallel: false` might be more stable, though slower.

### Example of Adjusting Batch Sizes and Parallelism

```cypher
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
    "
    MATCH (n:User)
    WHERE n.managerid IS NOT NULL 
      AND ('Employee' IN labels(n) OR 'Contractors' IN labels(n))
    RETURN n
    ",
    "
    // Step 2: Delete mismatched relationships
    OPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r:REPORTS_TO]->(m:User)
    WHERE 
        (NOT TOUPPER(n.managerid) STARTS WITH 'A' AND n.managerid <> m.employeeNumber)
        OR (TOUPPER(n.managerid) STARTS WITH 'A' AND n.managerid <> m.aetnaresourceid)
    DELETE r
    ",
    {batchSize: 500, parallel: false}  // Smaller batch size and sequential processing
);
```

### Monitoring Performance

After splitting the query into batches, monitor the query performance using `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` to check for improvements or identify further bottlenecks. This will help you tune the batch size, adjust the query, and ensure that your process is optimized.

By breaking your task into manageable chunks with batch processing, you can significantly improve performance while keeping the system stable and responsive, especially if you're dealing with a large number of nodes and relationships.
