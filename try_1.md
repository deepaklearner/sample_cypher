i want to add "nid_assignment_rules = data_mapping['nid_assignment_rule']" what changes i need to make in the code

To add `nid_assignment_rules = data_mapping['nid_assignment_rule']` to the code, you'll need to integrate it in a way that allows you to process these additional rules just like the `aid_assignment_rules`. This likely involves iterating over `nid_assignment_rules` and applying similar filtering logic as you did with `aid_assignment_rules`.

Let's go through the necessary changes step by step:

### Step 1: Extract `nid_assignment_rules`
First, add a line to extract the `nid_assignment_rules` from the `data_mapping` dictionary. Place this after the `aid_assignment_rules` line:

```python
aid_assignment_rules = data_mapping['aid_assignment_rule']
nid_assignment_rules = data_mapping['nid_assignment_rule']
```

### Step 2: Apply Filters for `nid_assignment_rules`
Next, you need to process `nid_assignment_rules` in the same way that `aid_assignment_rules` is processed. If `nid_assignment_rules` contains filtering logic, you should combine the two filters (`aid_assignment_rules` and `nid_assignment_rules`).

You can do this by creating a new filter variable for `nid_assignment_rules` and combining it with the existing `combined_filter`.

### Step 3: Modify the Filtering Logic to Handle Both `aid_assignment_rules` and `nid_assignment_rules`
You can iterate over `nid_assignment_rules` and apply the same filtering logic as for `aid_assignment_rules`. Then, you can combine the resulting filter from `nid_assignment_rules` with `combined_filter` using the logical OR (`|=`) operator.

Hereâ€™s how you would modify the code:

### Full Modified Code:

```python
def data_manipulation_AetnaIdentifier(data_mapping: dict, df: pd.DataFrame):
    # Extract assignment rules from the mapping dictionary
    aid_assignment_rules = data_mapping['aid_assignment_rule']
    nid_assignment_rules = data_mapping['nid_assignment_rule']  # New line for NID assignment rules

    # Filter rows where 'employmentStatus' is 'A'
    df = df[df['employmentStatus'] == 'A']

    # Ignore warnings
    warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore')

    # Clean the 'organizationId' column by splitting at '.' and keeping the first part
    df['organizationId'] = df['organizationId'].str.split('.').str[0]

    # Initialize combined filter
    combined_filter = None

    # Apply filtering based on 'aid_assignment_rules'
    for rule in aid_assignment_rules:
        filtered_val = None
        for key, val in rule.items():
            # Convert column values to uppercase
            df[key] = df[key].str.upper()
            # Check if values are in 'val' list
            if filtered_val is None:
                filtered_val = df[key].isin(val)
            else:
                filtered_val &= df[key].isin(val)

        # Combine filters for aid rules
        if combined_filter is None:
            combined_filter = filtered_val
        else:
            combined_filter |= filtered_val  # OR combine filters for each rule

    # Apply filtering based on 'nid_assignment_rules' (new logic)
    for rule in nid_assignment_rules:
        filtered_val = None
        for key, val in rule.items():
            # Convert column values to uppercase
            df[key] = df[key].str.upper()
            # Check if values are in 'val' list
            if filtered_val is None:
                filtered_val = df[key].isin(val)
            else:
                filtered_val &= df[key].isin(val)

        # Combine filters for nid rules (OR combine with aid rules)
        if combined_filter is None:
            combined_filter = filtered_val
        else:
            combined_filter |= filtered_val  # OR combine filters for each rule

    # Apply the combined filter to the DataFrame
    df = df[combined_filter]

    # Convert all columns to string type
    df = df.astype(str)

    # Log the filtered DataFrame
    logging.info(df)

    return df
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Extract `nid_assignment_rules`:**
   ```python
   nid_assignment_rules = data_mapping['nid_assignment_rule']
   ```

   This line is added immediately after extracting `aid_assignment_rules` from the `data_mapping`.

2. **Processing `nid_assignment_rules`:**
   - You are iterating over `nid_assignment_rules` just like `aid_assignment_rules`.
   - Inside the loop for `nid_assignment_rules`, each rule is processed in the same way as `aid_assignment_rules`. The filter conditions are accumulated and combined with the existing `combined_filter`.

3. **Combining `aid_assignment_rules` and `nid_assignment_rules`:**
   - After applying the `aid_assignment_rules` filter, the result is stored in `combined_filter`.
   - Then, as the `nid_assignment_rules` are processed, the new filters are combined with `combined_filter` using the logical OR operator (`|=`). This ensures that rows satisfying **either** the `aid_assignment_rules **or** the `nid_assignment_rules` will be included.

4. **Final Filter Application:**
   - After processing both sets of rules, `combined_filter` is applied to the DataFrame to filter the rows:
   ```python
   df = df[combined_filter]
   ```

### Final Notes:
- By adding `nid_assignment_rules`, you allow the function to filter the DataFrame based on two sets of rules: one for "aid" and one for "nid". 
- Both sets of rules are combined using logical OR (`|=`) so that a row is included if it satisfies **any** of the conditions from either rule set.

### Example:

If `aid_assignment_rules` has conditions like:
```python
aid_assignment_rules = [{'employmentStatus': ['A'], 'organizationId': ['A']}]
```
And `nid_assignment_rules` has conditions like:
```python
nid_assignment_rules = [{'employmentStatus': ['A'], 'organizationId': ['B']}]
```

Then, rows that match either:
- `employmentStatus == 'A' and organizationId == 'A'`
- `employmentStatus == 'A' and organizationId == 'B'`

Will be included in the final filtered DataFrame.
