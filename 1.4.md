Perfect ‚Äî if you **don‚Äôt want to track missing users** (i.e., you want to completely ignore any `employeeNumber` that doesn't exist in Neo4j), then your current approach using an **inner join** is spot on.

---

### ‚úÖ What you have now (and why it works well):

```python
# Only keep rows for which Neo4j returned labels
merged_df = employee_df.merge(labels_df, on='employeeNumber', how='inner')
```

This means:

* Employees **not found** in Neo4j are silently excluded.
* You only validate those who are present in both the DataFrame and the Neo4j graph.
* Your mismatch logic will now run **only on known users**, without logging or tracking missing ones.

---

### ‚úÖ Then apply your mismatch logic:

```python
cond_contractor_wrong_record = merged_df.apply(
    lambda row: 'Contractor' in row['labels'] and row['recordType'] != 'Conversion', axis=1
)

cond_status_mismatch = merged_df.apply(
    lambda row: (
        row['employmentStatus'] in ['A', 'L'] and
        not any(label in ['Active', 'OnLeave'] for label in row['labels'])
    ), axis=1
)

merged_df['Reason'] = ""
merged_df.loc[cond_contractor_wrong_record, 'Reason'] = "Contractor label present but recordType is not 'Conversion'"
merged_df.loc[cond_status_mismatch, 'Reason'] = (
    "employmentStatus in ['A','L'] but missing 'Active'/'OnLeave' label in Neo4j"
)

mismatch_df = merged_df[merged_df['Reason'] != ''][['employeeNumber', 'Reason']]
valid_df = df[~df['employeeNumber'].isin(mismatch_df['employeeNumber'])]
```

---

### üü¢ Summary

* ‚úÖ **Inner join** keeps only matched users ‚Äî simple and fast.
* ‚ùå No tracking/logging of missing Neo4j nodes.
* ‚úÖ Clean `mismatch_df` with only actual mismatches among valid nodes.

If you later want to **optionally toggle** tracking of missing nodes (e.g. for debugging), let me know and I can show you how to add that as a flag.
