Great question — **batch validation is much more efficient** than validating each owner individually. Here’s a comparison and the best approach:

---

### ✅ **Why Batch Validation is Better**

| Criteria         | Per-Owner Validation                 | Batch Validation                            |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**  | One query per owner × 3 × 50K rows   | One query for all unique owners per batch    |
| **Network Load** | High (multiple round trips)          | Low (one round trip)                         |
| **Code Complexity** | More conditionals/logic inline   | Cleaner, simpler, more scalable              |
| **Error Reporting** | Harder to correlate               | Easier — you can tag owner with entitlement in one go |

---

### 🔄 **Recommended Batch Validation Approach**

1. **Step 1: Extract all unique owners** from the batch (i.e., from owner1, owner2, owner3).
2. **Step 2: Run a Neo4j query** like this:
   ```cypher
   UNWIND $owners AS empNum
   MATCH (u:User {employeeNumber: empNum})
   WHERE NOT 'Disabled' IN labels(u)
   RETURN u.employeeNumber AS empNum
   ```
   - This returns all valid, active users.
3. **Step 3: Compare against extracted owners**
   - Flag owners that are missing or disabled.
4. **Step 4: Only create `HAS_OWNER` relationships for the valid ones.**

---

### 🧠 Implementation Tip

In Python:
- Use a `set()` to track all unique owner values from the current batch.
- Use Neo4j to return a set of valid ones.
- Subtract to find invalid owners.
- Join this result with the entitlements to prepare error records.

Here’s a clear and modular example in Python using batch owner validation with Neo4j. It assumes you're using:

- `neo4j` Python driver (`neo4j>=5.x`)
- `mysql-connector-python` for MySQL
- CSV logging for errors

---

## 🧩 **Step-by-Step Code Example**

### 🔧 1. **Setup**
```python
from neo4j import GraphDatabase
import mysql.connector
import csv

# MySQL connection
mysql_conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="your_host", user="your_user", password="your_password", database="edwmaster"
)
cursor = mysql_conn.cursor(dictionary=True)

# Neo4j driver
neo4j_driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))
```

---

### 🏗️ 2. **Batch Owner Validation Function**
```python
def get_valid_owners(driver, owner_ids):
    query = """
    UNWIND $owners AS empNum
    MATCH (u:User {employeeNumber: empNum})
    WHERE NOT 'Disabled' IN labels(u)
    RETURN u.employeeNumber AS empNum
    """
    with driver.session() as session:
        result = session.run(query, owners=list(owner_ids))
        return set([record["empNum"] for record in result])
```

---

### 🔄 3. **Main ETL Function**
```python
def process_batch(offset=0, batch_size=50000):
    cursor.execute(f"""
        SELECT entitle_name, entitle_desc, risk_rating, priv, resource_type,
               entitle_source, owner1, owner2, owner3
        FROM entitlement_master
        LIMIT {batch_size} OFFSET {offset}
    """)
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    entitlements = []
    all_owners = set()
    errors = []

    for row in rows:
        # Gather all owner IDs
        for owner_key in ['owner1', 'owner2', 'owner3']:
            if row[owner_key]:
                all_owners.add(row[owner_key])

    # Validate owners in batch
    valid_owners = get_valid_owners(neo4j_driver, all_owners)

    # Build final payload
    relationships = []
    for row in rows:
        ent = {
            "entitlementName": row["entitle_name"],
            "targetSystem": row["entitle_source"],
            "description": row["entitle_desc"],
            "riskLevel": row["risk_rating"],
            "priviledgedAccess": row["priv"],
            "entitlementType": row["resource_type"],
            "entitlementID": f"{row['entitle_name']}|{row['entitle_source']}"  # Custom ID
        }
        entitlements.append(ent)

        for owner_key in ['owner1', 'owner2', 'owner3']:
            owner_id = row[owner_key]
            if owner_id:
                if owner_id in valid_owners:
                    relationships.append({
                        "entitlementName": ent["entitlementName"],
                        "targetSystem": ent["targetSystem"],
                        "owner": owner_id
                    })
                else:
                    errors.append({
                        "entitlementName": ent["entitlementName"],
                        "targetSystem": ent["targetSystem"],
                        "owner": owner_id,
                        "reason": "Invalid or Disabled User"
                    })

    return entitlements, relationships, errors
```

### 🗃️ 4. **Neo4j Load Function**
```python
def load_to_neo4j(driver, entitlements, relationships):
    with driver.session() as session:
        # Load Entitlement nodes
        session.run("""
        UNWIND $batch AS row
        MERGE (e:Entitlement {entitlementName: row.entitlementName, targetSystem: row.targetSystem})
        SET e.entitlementID = row.entitlementID,
            e.description = row.description,
            e.riskLevel = row.riskLevel,
            e.priviledgedAccess = row.priviledgedAccess,
            e.entitlementType = row.entitlementType
        """, batch=entitlements)

        # Create relationships
        session.run("""
        UNWIND $relationships as rel
        MATCH (e:Entitlement {entitlementName: rel.entitlementName, targetSystem: rel.targetSystem})
        MATCH (u:User {employeeNumber: rel.owner})
        WHERE NOT 'Disabled' IN labels(u)
        MERGE (e)-[:HAS_OWNER]->(u)
        """, relationships=relationships)
```

---

### 📄 5. **Error Logging**
```python
def write_errors_to_csv(errors, file_name="owner_errors.csv"):
    with open(file_name, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["entitlementName", "targetSystem", "owner", "reason"])
        writer.writeheader()
        writer.writerows(errors)
```

---

### 🚀 6. **Running the ETL**
```python
offset = 0
batch_size = 50000

while True:
    entitlements, relationships, errors = process_batch(offset, batch_size)
    if not entitlements:
        break  # No more data
    load_to_neo4j(neo4j_driver, entitlements, relationships)
    write_errors_to_csv(errors, f"errors_offset_{offset}.csv")
    offset += batch_size
```
