I have a pandas dataframe df with many columns, one of the field is managerid.
I have a User node in neo4j db with property employeeNumber and managerid.

write a cypher query to validate every record in dataframe df, if the managerid exists in neo4j db then include it else exclude the record from df and add in missing_data_vendors.

Use UNWIND in cypher. Also keep the existing logic of rejection in below method.
 
def identify_vendor_reject_records(df):
    """
    Function to identify valid records for vendors and missing data vendors.
    """

    # Get the set of all employee IDs
    total_emps = set(df['CM_PERS_ID'])

    # Filter out records with missing or invalid data
    df = df[
        ~(df['START_DATE'] == 'DNE') &
        ~(df['END_DATE'] == 'DNE') &
        ~(df['MANAGER_ID'] == 'DNE') &
        ~(df['FIRST_NAME'] == 'DNE') &
        ~(df['LAST_NAME'] == 'DNE') &
        ~(df['CX_PV_SOURCE'] == 'DNE')
    ]

    # Identify missing data vendors
    missing_data_vendors = total_emps - set(df['CM_PERS_ID'])

    return df, missing_data_vendors
