CREATE INDEX idx_eservice ON eservice_data(entitle_name, platform, rank);




Great question ‚Äî the query I gave is **functionally correct**, but whether it's **efficient** depends on:

### ‚úÖ Factors Supporting Efficiency:

1. **Indexes**: If both tables have indexes on:

   * `entitle_name`
   * `entitle_source` (in `entitlement_master`)
   * `platform` and `rank` (in `eservice_data`)
     then the join and filtering will be fairly efficient.

2. **Data Volume**: If the dataset is not massive (say, under a few million rows), this approach will perform well enough on most modern databases.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Performance Bottlenecks:

1. **Pivoting With `CASE` + `MAX`**:

   * This works well for a small, known number of ranks (like 1 to 3).
   * If you have many ranks (10+), performance drops and the query becomes harder to maintain.

2. **Missing or Poor Indexes**:

   * Lack of composite indexes (e.g. `(entitle_name, platform)` in `eservice_data`) can make the join slow.

3. **Large Joins**:

   * If both tables are large and the join is not selective (i.e., many-to-many explosion), performance will degrade.

### üîß Tips to Improve Efficiency:

* **Add indexes**:

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_eservice ON eservice_data(entitle_name, platform, rank);
  ```
* **Limit the number of ranks** you pivot (e.g., only 1 to 3, as in your case).
* If the table is huge and performance becomes a concern, consider **materialized views** or **denormalizing** the data.
