You can replace the original logic that filters rows not containing "Active" or "OnLeave" by instead checking if **"Terminated"** is **not present**. Here's how you can rewrite it:

### ✅ Updated Code:

```python
# New logic: Filter rows where 'Terminated' label is NOT present
terminated_label = ~df['labels'].apply(
    lambda labels: any(l == 'Terminated' for l in labels)
)
reject_employment_status_df = df[terminated_label]
```

### 🔍 Explanation:

* `terminated_label` is a boolean Series where each row is `True` if `"Terminated"` is **not** in the `labels` list.
* `reject_employment_status_df` contains rows where the `labels` do **not** include `"Terminated"`.

Let me know if `"Terminated"` should be case-insensitive or if the labels column has a different structure (e.g., string instead of list).
