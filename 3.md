If you have a column in your DataFrame called `ManagerLevel` that corresponds to a column named `level` in the MySQL table, you will need to **map** that column specifically, since their names don’t match.

This is common when column names in your DataFrame don't exactly match those in the table, but it's easy to handle with a **mapping**.

### Here's the solution to handle this situation:

1. **Create a column mapping** that links the DataFrame columns to the MySQL table columns. This mapping will allow you to adjust the column name mismatch (like `ManagerLevel` → `level`).
2. **Ensure the columns are inserted in the correct order**, even if the names differ.

### Updated Approach for 109 Columns (with Mapping for `ManagerLevel` → `level`):

1. **Step 1: Create a Mapping** for the columns.
2. **Step 2: Reorder the DataFrame** according to the table’s column order.
3. **Step 3: Adjust the Data Insertion** with the correct column names and use placeholders.

### Full Example Code with Column Mapping:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql

# Example DataFrame (for illustration, this DataFrame has 109 columns)
# Let's say this is your DataFrame with a column 'ManagerLevel' which should map to 'level'
df = pd.DataFrame({
    f'column_{i}': range(1, 6) for i in range(1, 109)
})

# Add the column that needs to be renamed for the MySQL table
df['ManagerLevel'] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Sample data for ManagerLevel

# Connect to MySQL using pymysql
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='yourdb'
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 1: Get the column names from your MySQL table (ensure the correct order)
cursor.execute("DESCRIBE your_table;")
table_columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.fetchall()]

# Step 2: Create a column mapping to handle the name mismatch (ManagerLevel → level)
column_mapping = {
    'ManagerLevel': 'level',  # Map 'ManagerLevel' in DataFrame to 'level' in MySQL
}

# Make sure the DataFrame columns are in the same order as the table columns, applying any necessary mapping
df_columns = df.columns.tolist()

# Adjust the DataFrame columns according to the mapping (rename 'ManagerLevel' to 'level')
df.rename(columns=column_mapping, inplace=True)

# Now, reorder the DataFrame columns to match the table columns (using the table's column names)
df = df[table_columns]

# Step 3: Generate placeholders for the SQL query based on the number of columns in the table
placeholders = ', '.join(['%s'] * len(table_columns))  # %s repeated for each column

# Prepare the SQL query with dynamically generated placeholders
insert_query = f"INSERT INTO your_table ({', '.join(table_columns)}) VALUES ({placeholders})"

# Step 4: Prepare data for insertion, ensuring the order matches the table's columns
data_to_insert = [tuple(df[column] for column in table_columns) for _, row in df.iterrows()]

# Step 5: Execute the query in batches (use executemany for batch inserts)
batch_size = 1000  # Example batch size (adjust as needed)
for start in range(0, len(df), batch_size):
    end = start + batch_size
    batch = data_to_insert[start:end]
    cursor.executemany(insert_query, batch)
    conn.commit()  # Commit the batch insert operation

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of Changes:

1. **Column Mapping**:
   - In the `column_mapping`, we specifically map the **`ManagerLevel`** column in the DataFrame to **`level`** in the MySQL table:
     ```python
     column_mapping = {
         'ManagerLevel': 'level',  # Map 'ManagerLevel' in DataFrame to 'level' in MySQL
     }
     ```
   - This mapping ensures that when we insert the data, the column `ManagerLevel` in the DataFrame will correctly match the column `level` in the MySQL table.

2. **Renaming the DataFrame Column**:
   - We rename the `ManagerLevel` column in the DataFrame to `level` using `df.rename(columns=column_mapping, inplace=True)`:
     ```python
     df.rename(columns=column_mapping, inplace=True)
     ```
   - This step ensures that after the renaming, the DataFrame will have the correct column name (`level`) that matches the table's column.

3. **Reordering the Columns**:
   - We then reorder the DataFrame’s columns to match the order of columns in the MySQL table using `df = df[table_columns]`.

4. **Generating the Query**:
   - The `insert_query` is created dynamically, ensuring that the placeholders (`%s`) match the number of columns in the table, and it uses the correct column order from `table_columns`.

5. **Batch Insert**:
   - The data is inserted in batches using `executemany()` for efficient insertion. Each batch contains up to 1000 rows (adjustable).

### Benefits of This Approach:

- **Column Name Mapping**: The `ManagerLevel` → `level` column mapping ensures that the columns in the DataFrame and table are correctly matched, even when their names differ.
- **Column Order Doesn’t Matter**: The DataFrame columns are reordered to match the table columns, so the order in the DataFrame doesn’t need to be the same as the order in the table.
- **Scalability**: The code works even for large DataFrames with 109 columns, ensuring the insertion is efficient and safe.

### Final Thoughts:

This method ensures that the insertion is robust and will work regardless of column name mismatches or the order of columns in your DataFrame. Even if you add new columns or change the order in your DataFrame, as long as the column names in the DataFrame and the table match (or you adjust the mapping), the code will handle the insertion seamlessly.
