If a **Cypher query** is stuck during your **ETL process**, and you're using **Neo4j**, here‚Äôs where to check logs and how to troubleshoot:

---

### üîç **Primary Log Files in Neo4j**

These are usually found in the `logs/` directory inside your Neo4j installation or data directory.

1. **`debug.log`**

   * **Path:** `$NEO4J_HOME/logs/debug.log`
   * **Use:** Detailed diagnostic information including slow queries, transactions, memory issues, and deadlocks.

2. **`neo4j.log`**

   * **Path:** `$NEO4J_HOME/logs/neo4j.log`
   * **Use:** General startup/shutdown info, and major events.

3. **`query.log`** (if enabled)

   * **Path:** `$NEO4J_HOME/logs/query.log`
   * **Use:** Logs slow or long-running queries. Useful for profiling ETL behavior.
   * **Enable in config (optional):**

     ```ini
     db.query.logs.enabled=true
     db.query.logs.threshold=1s
     ```

4. **`system.log`** (Neo4j 5.x and above, if using Fabric or multiple databases)

   * Might contain routing or system database issues.

### üß™ If You‚Äôre Using APOC or Custom Procedures

* Check for exceptions or logs in `debug.log`, especially if your query involves `apoc.periodic.iterate`, `apoc.load.csv`, etc.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è ETL Tool Logs

Depending on how you're running the ETL:

* **Neo4j ETL Tool (official desktop app)**:

  * Check logs in the application folder or GUI.
* **Custom Python/Java/Scala ETL scripts**:

  * Check the STDOUT/STDERR logs or your application logs.
* **Dockerized Neo4j**:

  * Run:

    ```bash
    docker logs <container-name>
    ```

---

### ‚úÖ Tips to Unstick a Query

* Use `:queries` in **Neo4j Browser** to list running queries and cancel long ones.
* Use `CALL dbms.listQueries()` to inspect running queries in CLI or Cypher.
* Use `EXPLAIN` or `PROFILE` to optimize slow queries.

Let me know which version of Neo4j and what ETL tooling you‚Äôre using (e.g., Neo4j ETL tool, custom scripts, Apache NiFi, etc.), and I can give more targeted advice.
