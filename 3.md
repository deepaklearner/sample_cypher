To print the `resourceid` values from the `df` DataFrame that are not present in the `iamidsidentities` table, you can perform the following additional steps in your code:

1. Query the `resourceid` values from the `iamidsidentities` table.
2. Compare the `resourceid` values in the `df` DataFrame with the ones retrieved from the `iamidsidentities` table.
3. Print those `resourceid` values that are not found in `iamidsidentities`.

You can add the following code just before processing the batches:

```python
# Step 6: Retrieve the resourceid values from the MySQL table 'iamidsidentities'
cursor.execute("SELECT resourceid FROM glide.iamidsidentities;")
existing_resource_ids = set(row[0] for row in cursor.fetchall())

# Step 7: Find resourceid values in df that are not in iamidsidentities
missing_resource_ids = df[~df['resourceid'].isin(existing_resource_ids)]['resourceid'].tolist()

# Log the missing resourceid values
if missing_resource_ids:
    print(f"Missing resourceid values from iamidsidentities: {missing_resource_ids}")
else:
    print("No missing resourceid values found.")
```

### Explanation of Changes:
- **Step 6**: Executes a `SELECT` query to fetch all the `resourceid` values from the `iamidsidentities` table.
- **Step 7**: Compares the `resourceid` values in the `df` DataFrame with the values from the database (`existing_resource_ids`) using the `isin()` function to check which `resourceid` values are missing.
- The missing `resourceid` values are collected into a list and printed to the log.

Make sure to place this new code right after the setup steps but before starting the batch processing.

This will ensure that if any `resourceid` is present in the DataFrame but not in the `iamidsidentities` table, it will be logged as missing.
