To optimize the `update_data_to_identities` function, here are a few strategies you can consider:

### 1. **Reduce Redundant Data Fetching (existing resource IDs)**
   - Right now, for each batch, you're checking for the existence of each resource ID in the database by fetching all existing `resourceid`s and comparing them against the batch. This could be optimized by:
     - **Using a `WHERE NOT EXISTS` SQL condition**: Rather than fetching all existing `resourceid`s from the database and filtering them in Python, you could incorporate the check directly into the SQL query to reduce the amount of data being fetched.
     - **Bulk checking in the SQL query**: This can help minimize the number of database calls and move some of the computation into the database, which is usually much more efficient.

   Example SQL to check for missing `resourceid`:
   ```sql
   SELECT resourceid FROM glide.glideidentities 
   WHERE resourceid IN (%s) AND resourceid NOT IN (SELECT resourceid FROM glide.glideidentities);
   ```
   
   This way, you only retrieve the missing `resourceid`s rather than all existing ones.

### 2. **Efficient Batching with Conditional Updates**
   - Right now, you're always performing an `UPDATE` for each record in the batch, even if no changes are required. You could:
     - **Skip updates if no changes are detected**: Before preparing the `UPDATE` query, compare the values in the batch to those in the database, and only perform the update when changes are detected. This saves unnecessary write operations.

   Example SQL for efficient update:
   ```sql
   UPDATE glide.glideidentities 
   SET col1 = %s, col2 = %s
   WHERE resourceid = %s AND (col1 != %s OR col2 != %s);
   ```
   This will only update if the values differ.

### 3. **Bulk Update with SQL's `CASE WHEN` for Multiple Rows**
   - Instead of using `UPDATE` with individual records, you can use `CASE WHEN` statements to update multiple rows in a single query. This avoids executing `executemany` multiple times.

   Example bulk update query:
   ```sql
   UPDATE glide.glideidentities 
   SET 
       col1 = CASE WHEN resourceid = %s THEN %s ELSE col1 END,
       col2 = CASE WHEN resourceid = %s THEN %s ELSE col2 END
   WHERE resourceid IN (%s, %s, %s, ...);
   ```

   This approach minimizes the number of queries sent to the database.

### 4. **Minimize Data Transformation Overhead**
   - The `prepare_data_for_update` function currently does a lot of work in terms of renaming columns, filtering them, and preparing values. You could try to do this in bulk:
     - If possible, avoid unnecessary transformations and streamline the operations to work directly with the database.
   
   For example, using pandas' `apply` or vectorized operations might help reduce some overhead when preparing the `batch_values` list.

### 5. **Optimize Logging and Commit Operations**
   - **Avoid excessive logging**: Logging every single batch of missing resource IDs could be causing unnecessary overhead, especially when there are many records. Consider logging only at a higher level, like logging every `N` batches.
   - **Batch commits**: Right now, you're committing after every batch. Depending on your transaction settings and size, this might be causing excessive database writes. You can try grouping multiple batches into a single transaction to improve performance.

   Example:
   ```python
   for start in range(0, len(df_new), chunk_size):
       end = start + chunk_size
       batch = df_new.iloc[start:end]
       ...
       # prepare the data to update
       update_data_batch(cursor, update_query_template, data_to_update)
   
   # Commit once after all batches
   self.glide_connection.commit()
   ```

### 6. **Database Indexing**
   - **Ensure proper indexing**: Make sure that the `resourceid` column is indexed in the `glide.glideidentities` table. This will help improve query performance, particularly when you're performing `SELECT` and `UPDATE` operations involving the `resourceid`.
   - You can check the indexing of the `resourceid` column and other relevant columns to ensure they are indexed properly.

### 7. **Parallelization (if applicable)**
   - If your database and environment support it, you can parallelize the updates. You can split the `df` DataFrame into multiple chunks and process them simultaneously using threads or multiple database connections. However, this would depend on your system's configuration and whether concurrent updates are allowed to the same table.

### Revised version of `update_data_to_identities` with some improvements:

```python
def update_data_to_identities(self, df, chunk_size=10000):
    """
    Update data in Glide identities table
    """
    try:
        cursor = self.glide_connection.cursor()
        table_columns = get_table_columns(cursor)
        df_new, req_columns, set_clause = prepare_data_for_update(df, table_columns)
        update_query_template = f"UPDATE glide.glideidentities SET {set_clause} WHERE resourceid = %s AND ({' OR '.join([f'{col} != %s' for col in req_columns])})"

        for start in range(0, len(df_new), chunk_size):
            end = start + chunk_size
            batch = df_new.iloc[start:end]
            resourceid_ids_in_batch = batch['resourceid'].tolist()

            # Get only the missing resourceids in a single query
            existing_resource_ids = get_existing_resource_ids(cursor, resourceid_ids_in_batch)
            missing_resource_ids = [resource_id for resource_id in resourceid_ids_in_batch if resource_id not in existing_resource_ids]
            log_missing_resource_ids(missing_resource_ids)

            batch_values = batch.values
            data_to_update = []
            req_columns_idx = [df_new.columns.get_loc(col) for col in req_columns]
            resourceid_idx = df_new.columns.get_loc('resourceid')

            for row in batch_values:
                row_data = [row[idx] for idx in req_columns_idx]
                resourceid_id = row[resourceid_idx]
                data_to_update.append(tuple(row_data + [resourceid_id] * len(req_columns)))

            update_data_batch(cursor, update_query_template, data_to_update)

        self.glide_connection.commit()
        cursor.close()
        logging.info(f"Data updated in Glide identities table successfully for {len(df_new)} records.")
    
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error fetching data: {str(e)} - Debug <Class: IAM DataExport | Method: update_data_to_identities()>")
        if self.glide_connection:
            self.glide_connection.rollback()
        raise
```
