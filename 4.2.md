An **`OperationalError`** in `mysql.connector` (and other DB libraries like `psycopg2` for PostgreSQL) refers to **low-level database problems** that typically prevent a query or connection from succeeding.

### ‚úÖ Common causes of `OperationalError` include:

1. **Lost or dropped database connection**

   * Network issues
   * DB server restarted or closed the connection
   * Timeout due to long-running operation or idle connection

2. **Database server not reachable**

   * Wrong host/IP or port
   * Firewall blocks

3. **Too many connections**

   * Server limit reached (`max_connections`)

4. **Authentication issues** (sometimes)

   * Wrong credentials (though this can also raise `ProgrammingError`)

5. **Transaction or lock timeouts**

### üîç Example:

```python
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import OperationalError

try:
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",
        user="user",
        password="wrong_password",
        database="test"
    )
except OperationalError as e:
    print("Caught OperationalError:", e)
```

### üéØ Why handle it?

If you're pulling millions of rows in batches and the connection drops mid-way (due to a network glitch or DB hiccup), catching `OperationalError` allows you to **retry** instead of crashing the whole job.
