Certainly! Here's a more compact version of the Cypher query that updates the properties of `User` and `AetnaNetworkIdentifier` nodes based on the data from MySQL (assuming it's passed as a parameter):

### Compact Cypher Query:

```cypher
UNWIND $cvs_resource_data AS row
MATCH (u:User {employeeNumber: row.CVSResourceid})
MATCH (a:AetnaNetworkIdentifier {networkid: row.cvsnetworkid})
MATCH (u)-[r:HAS_AETNA_ID]->(a)

SET u.employeeNumber = row.CVSResourceid,
    u.aetnaresourceid = row.AetnaResourceid,
    u.cvsnetworkid = row.cvsnetworkid,
    u.cid = row.cid,
    a.uid = row.AetnaResourceid,
    r.assigned_date = datetime();
```

### Explanation:
- **UNWIND**: Iterates over the rows of the data passed as a parameter (`$cvs_resource_data`).
- **MATCH**: Directly matches `User` and `AetnaNetworkIdentifier` nodes by their properties (`employeeNumber` and `networkid`).
- **SET**: Updates all properties of the `User` and `AetnaNetworkIdentifier` nodes, as well as the relationship's `assigned_date`, to the values from MySQL. 
  - This is done unconditionally (replacing old values with the new ones).
  - The `assigned_date` is set to the current timestamp (`datetime()`).
  
### Notes:
- This query assumes that the properties of the `User` and `AetnaNetworkIdentifier` nodes should always be overwritten with the values from the `row`.
- The condition on the `MATCH` clause ensures that only the correct nodes are selected based on the values from MySQL.

This compact version removes the `CASE WHEN` checks for differences, assuming that you want to update all fields to the new values directly. It simplifies the query by removing the need for conditional logic but might result in more frequent updates than the previous version.
