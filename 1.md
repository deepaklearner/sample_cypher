Developing a tool like Process Lasso by Bitsum to optimize Windows laptop performance is an ambitious project. Here are the key features and components you would need to consider:

1. CPU Optimization:
   - Implement a system to dynamically adjust process priorities[6].
   - Create an algorithm like ProBalance to maintain system responsiveness during high CPU loads[6].
   - Develop a feature to manage CPU affinities for running processes[6].

2. Power Management:
   - Include options to switch between power plans automatically based on running applications[6].
   - Implement a custom high-performance power plan[6].

3. Memory Management:
   - Develop a feature to monitor and optimize RAM usage[5].
   - Implement a ReadyBoost-like functionality for using USB drives to enhance performance[5].

4. Process Automation:
   - Create a system for setting persistent process priorities and CPU affinities[6].
   - Implement a process watchdog for advanced rules and automation[6].

5. Performance Monitoring:
   - Develop a real-time monitoring system for CPU, memory, and disk usage[6].
   - Create a custom metric for measuring system responsiveness[6].

6. User Interface:
   - Design an intuitive interface for users to view and manage running processes[9].
   - Implement pre-set templates for quick performance optimization[9].

7. Additional Features:
   - Include a disk cleanup utility to remove unnecessary files[5].
   - Implement a startup manager to control which applications launch at boot[5].

To develop such a tool, you would need strong programming skills in languages like C++ or C#, a deep understanding of Windows internals and API, and knowledge of low-level system optimization techniques. It's a complex project that would require significant time and expertise to create a reliable and effective tool.
