This code defines a function `delta_src_vs_gdb_usrs_usraccts_profiles` that is designed to identify the "delta" of user accounts between two datasets: one from a source system (`src_usraccts_for_each_usr`) and the other from a graph database (`gdb_usrs_with_usraccts_has_oneid_list`). The goal is to find differences in user accounts between the source and the graph data, particularly for user accounts that don't have a corresponding "OneID" in the graph. The function processes this data and returns a list of new and removed user accounts, along with other relevant data. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

### Key Variables:
1. **`src_usraccts_for_each_usr`**: A pandas DataFrame that represents user accounts from the source system.
2. **`gdb_usrs_with_usraccts_has_oneid_list`**: A pandas DataFrame containing user accounts from the graph database (GDB) that have OneIDs assigned.

### Process Flow:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function starts by logging that it's identifying the delta of users and user accounts.
   - It initializes `new_pas_data` (to store new user accounts) and `removed_user_accounts` (to store removed accounts).
   - The two input DataFrames (`df1` and `df2`) are created from the arguments `src_usraccts_for_each_usr` and `gdb_usrs_with_usraccts_has_oneid_list`.

2. **Handling Removed Accounts**:
   - A new column `concat_attr_col` is added to `df1`, initialized to `None`.
   - The `removed_accounts` set is calculated by comparing `concat_attr_col` from `df2` (the graph) and `df1` (the source). This identifies user accounts that have been removed from the graph but are still present in the source.
   - For each removed account, the function logs the account details (except when the account is labeled as `UNASSIGNED`) and stores the removed account in `removed_user_accounts`.

3. **Handle Empty Source Data**:
   - If `df1` (source data) is empty, the function returns an empty DataFrame (`users_details_list1`) along with the removed accounts and new PAS (Password Authentication Service) data.

4. **Account Comparison**:
   - The function calculates two sets:
     - **`diff_accounts`**: User accounts that are in the source (`df1`) but not in the graph (`df2`).
     - **`updated_accounts`**: User accounts that have updated attributes in the source compared to the graph.
   - For each updated account, the function attempts to check if there are any changes in attributes (like `PrimaryAuth`, `accountType`, etc.) and logs warnings if such changes occur.

5. **Processing Updated Accounts**:
   - The function processes the updated accounts by merging relevant data from `df2` (the graph) and checking specific attributes (like `PrimaryAuth` and `accountType`).
   - If attributes like `PrimaryAuth` or `accountType` are found to have changed for a user, the account is marked and removed from the update list.
   - Valid updated accounts are then added to `new_pas_data`.

6. **Final Data Preparation**:
   - The function prepares the final DataFrame `df1_tbm` containing the user account details from the source (`df1`) that are in `diff_accounts`.
   - It merges this with `df2` to bring in `user_oneid` and `lastuseraccountoneid` from the graph data.

7. **User Details Grouping**:
   - For each `E_EmployeeID`, it applies the `extract` function (defined later) to gather the user account details.
   - The `extract` function is responsible for creating a structured dictionary of user account information, including `samaccountname`, `usracct_oneid`, `domain`, `extensionattribute3`, and `admin_description`.

8. **Return Results**:
   - Finally, the function returns:
     - `users_details_list`: A list of user account details for users identified as part of the delta.
     - `removed_user_accounts`: A list of removed user accounts.
     - `new_pas_data`: A list of new user accounts.

### `extract` Function:
The `extract` function is used to group and process the user account details for each `E_EmployeeID`. It extracts the OneID, last user account OneID, and details about each user account (e.g., `samaccountname`, `usracct_oneid`, `domain`, etc.) and returns a structured dictionary.

### Summary of Purpose:
This function is primarily used to:
- Identify new and removed user accounts based on the delta between the source data and the graph database.
- Process and track user account changes, particularly focusing on accounts that don't have a corresponding OneID.
- Prepare data for further processing or reporting based on changes in user accounts.

The function logs warnings about specific attribute changes and returns structured data about the user accounts that are new, removed, or updated, with a particular focus on users who lack a OneID in the graph.
