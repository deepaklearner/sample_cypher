Your Cypher query can be optimized for better performance and readability. Below are some improvements:  

### **Optimizations Applied**  
1. **Reduce `COALESCE` Calls**: Instead of calling `COALESCE` multiple times, it's better to use a `WITH` clause to store computed values and use them in `WHERE` conditions.  
2. **Avoid Redundant `MERGE` and `SET`**: The `MERGE` statement should set properties only if they donâ€™t exist to avoid unnecessary writes.  
3. **Optimize Conditional Updates**: Using `CASE` inside `SET` can sometimes lead to unnecessary updates. Instead, update only when necessary.  
4. **Batch Processing Friendly**: Using `UNWIND` efficiently ensures batch processing performs well.

### **Optimized Query**
```cypher
UNWIND $rows AS row
MATCH (usr:User {employeeNumber: row.CVSResourceid})  
WITH usr, row, 
     COALESCE(usr.cvsnetworkid, 'DNE') AS current_cvsnetworkid,
     COALESCE(usr.cid, 'DNE') AS current_cid  
WHERE (current_cvsnetworkid <> row.cvsnetworkid AND row.cvsnetworkid <> 'DNE')  
   OR (current_cid <> row.cvsnetworkid AND row.cid <> 'DNE')  

// Create or merge the new CVS identifier node  
MERGE (cvs_identifier:CVSNetworkIdentifier:NetworkIdentifier {networkid: row.cvsnetworkid})  
ON CREATE SET cvs_identifier.uid = row.cvsnetworkid  // No need to use substring(row.cvsnetworkid, 1)

// Create the relationship between the User and the new CVS identifier node  
MERGE (usr)-[r_has_cvsnetwork_id:HAS_CVSNETWORK_ID]->(cvs_identifier)  
ON CREATE SET r_has_cvsnetwork_id.assigned_date = localdatetime(),
              r_has_cvsnetwork_id.assignedBy = 'ServiceNow'  

// Update User properties only if necessary  
SET usr.cvsnetworkid = CASE WHEN row.cvsnetworkid <> 'DNE' AND current_cvsnetworkid <> row.cvsnetworkid THEN row.cvsnetworkid ELSE usr.cvsnetworkid END,  
    usr.cid = CASE WHEN row.cid <> 'DNE' AND current_cid <> row.cid THEN row.cid ELSE usr.cid END,  
    usr.is_updated = 'Y'  

RETURN count(*) AS total  
```

### **Key Improvements**  
âœ… **Avoids unnecessary `COALESCE` calls** by computing values in `WITH`.  
âœ… **Uses `ON CREATE SET` instead of `SET`** to prevent unnecessary writes on existing nodes.  
âœ… **Optimizes condition checks in `SET`** to ensure updates happen only if needed.  
âœ… **More readable and performant**, making it better suited for batch operations.
