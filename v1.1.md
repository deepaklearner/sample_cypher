I am working on a python ETL project in which, I am using two mysql databases and neo4j graph database.
I am reading the data from mysql, apply transformation and then write the data in neo4j.

Also, I have multiple repositories and and in one repo have multiple folders like EDWm EDW_CentralSources, INT5043_INT5353, HRHUB_CW, HRHUB_EMP etc

In future I want to integrate splunk with the logging mechanism. For that, I want to prepare a error code glossery (or a dictionary or errors codes) and use that to identify the errors uniquely. Suggest me ideas.


Creating an error code glossary or dictionary for your ETL process is an excellent idea, especially as you look to integrate Splunk for better logging and monitoring. Here's how you can structure and implement a robust error code glossary for your ETL project:

### 1. **Categorizing Errors**
   First, break down the errors into categories that correspond to different parts of the ETL pipeline and the technologies you are using (e.g., MySQL, Neo4j, transformations, etc.). Categories help you to group similar types of errors together and will make it easier to filter or search logs in the future.

   **Suggested categories:**
   - **MySQL Errors**: Issues related to the MySQL database (e.g., connection failures, query errors).
   - **Neo4j Errors**: Problems related to the graph database (e.g., node creation errors, graph traversal issues).
   - **Data Transformation Errors**: Issues with data processing or transformation logic (e.g., incorrect data format, data loss, etc.).
   - **File/IO Errors**: Errors related to reading or writing files (e.g., CSVs, logs).
   - **Connection/Networking Errors**: Network-related issues (e.g., API connectivity failures).
   - **General System Errors**: Errors in the broader system, such as memory issues or environment configuration problems.

### 2. **Creating Error Codes**
   To uniquely identify errors, create a systematic and structured approach for error codes. These codes should follow a format that allows you to categorize and identify the source of the issue quickly.

   **Example Format**: `[Category Code] - [Module] - [Error ID]`

   - **Category Code**: A two-letter code representing the error category (e.g., `DB` for database, `TRANS` for transformations).
   - **Module**: The specific part of the pipeline (e.g., `MySQL`, `Neo4j`, `Transform`).
   - **Error ID**: A unique numeric or alphanumeric identifier for the specific error.

   **Example Error Codes**:
   - `DB-MYSQL-001`: Connection failure to MySQL database.
   - `DB-MYSQL-002`: SQL syntax error during data extraction.
   - `TRANS-TF-001`: Invalid data type during transformation.
   - `NEO4J-NODE-001`: Failed to create node in Neo4j.
   - `IO-CSV-001`: File read failure for CSV.
   - `NET-API-002`: Timeout error during API call.
   
### 3. **Error Dictionary/Glossary**
   Maintain a dictionary or a glossary for your error codes. Each entry should provide a clear description of the error, possible causes, and suggested resolution steps.

   **Example Entry in the Glossary**:
   ```python
   ERROR_CODES = {
       'DB-MYSQL-001': {
           'description': 'Failed to connect to MySQL database.',
           'cause': 'Incorrect connection string, database server down, or network issues.',
           'resolution': 'Check the connection string, verify the database server is running, and ensure network connectivity.',
       },
       'DB-MYSQL-002': {
           'description': 'SQL query syntax error.',
           'cause': 'Incorrect SQL syntax or invalid parameters.',
           'resolution': 'Review the SQL query for correctness and ensure all parameters are valid.',
       },
       'TRANS-TF-001': {
           'description': 'Data type mismatch during transformation.',
           'cause': 'The source data type does not match the expected data type in transformation logic.',
           'resolution': 'Ensure that the source data types are correctly mapped to the expected target types in the transformation logic.',
       },
       'NEO4J-NODE-001': {
           'description': 'Failed to create node in Neo4j.',
           'cause': 'Incorrect Cypher query or schema violations.',
           'resolution': 'Review the Cypher query, check for schema violations, and ensure that data integrity constraints are respected.',
       },
       'IO-CSV-001': {
           'description': 'File read failure for CSV file.',
           'cause': 'The file is missing, inaccessible, or corrupted.',
           'resolution': 'Ensure the file exists, is accessible, and is not corrupted.',
       },
       'NET-API-002': {
           'description': 'Timeout error during API call.',
           'cause': 'The API server did not respond in a timely manner.',
           'resolution': 'Check the API server's status, increase the timeout setting if necessary, or investigate network issues.',
       }
   }
   ```

   You can store this dictionary in a separate configuration file (e.g., `error_codes.py`) or a database for easy maintenance and future expansion.

### 4. **Integrating with Splunk**
   When integrating Splunk for logging, the goal is to capture these error codes in your log messages. Ensure that your ETL pipeline logs these errors with the error code and relevant details to help you quickly identify the issue.

   Example log message:
   ```python
   import logging

   # Initialize logger
   logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

   # Error handling example
   try:
       # Your ETL code here
       pass
   except MySQLdb.Error as e:
       logger.error(f"Error Code: DB-MYSQL-001, Description: Failed to connect to MySQL. Cause: {str(e)}")
   ```

   In Splunk, you can set up searches and alerts that filter by the error code (e.g., `DB-MYSQL-001`) to track and address specific issues.

### 5. **Additional Recommendations**
   - **Version Control for Error Codes**: Track the version of your ETL system and error codes. This way, you can handle errors differently across various versions of the system.
   - **Automated Monitoring and Alerting**: Set up Splunk alerts based on error codes so that specific issues (e.g., `DB-MYSQL-001`) trigger notifications to the team.
   - **Error Severity Levels**: Assign severity levels to error codes (e.g., `LOW`, `MEDIUM`, `HIGH`, `CRITICAL`). This helps prioritize the resolution of issues in a more structured way.
   - **Data Validation**: Ensure that every piece of data passing through the ETL process is validated to catch common errors before they occur in production.

### 6. **Error Handling Best Practices**
   - **Graceful Failure**: In the event of an error, your ETL system should attempt to handle it gracefully, log the error, and potentially retry the operation (for transient errors).
   - **Error Context**: Log the context around the error, such as input data values, transformations applied, and the exact stage of the ETL pipeline where the error occurred.
   - **Error Resolution Workflow**: Set up a clear workflow for resolving common errors. For example, if an error like `DB-MYSQL-001` occurs, have a standard procedure for troubleshooting it.

By creating a well-structured error code system and integrating it into your ETL pipeline, youâ€™ll be able to quickly identify, track, and resolve issues, especially when you scale your logging system with Splunk.
