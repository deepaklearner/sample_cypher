Creating a tool like **Lasso** from Bitsum, which optimizes Windows laptop performance, requires a combination of system-level programming and user interface development. The language you choose depends on your familiarity with different programming paradigms and how deep you want to go into system optimization. Here are some good choices:

### 1. **C++**
   - **Why:** C++ is a great option for Windows optimization tools because it allows you to interact directly with the Windows API, providing control over system resources like memory, CPU usage, and process management.
   - **Pros:** 
     - Direct access to Windows internals via the Windows API.
     - Efficient and fast, crucial for system optimization.
     - Large support community and plenty of resources.
   - **Cons:**
     - Steeper learning curve compared to higher-level languages.
     - More code is required to achieve certain functionalities compared to higher-level languages.

### 2. **C# (with .NET Framework)**
   - **Why:** C# is a higher-level language that still provides powerful capabilities for Windows development, particularly with the .NET Framework. It’s widely used for building desktop applications and has great support for system-level tasks.
   - **Pros:**
     - Easier to learn compared to C++.
     - Access to the Windows API through .NET libraries.
     - Modern, fast, and well-documented language.
     - Strong support for GUI (Windows Forms or WPF) if you need a UI for your tool.
   - **Cons:**
     - Less direct control over low-level system resources than C++.
     - Potentially slower performance for high-performance tasks compared to C++.

### 3. **Python (with PyWin32 or ctypes)**
   - **Why:** Python is often seen as the easiest language to quickly prototype or build a tool. You can use libraries like **PyWin32** or **ctypes** to interact with the Windows API.
   - **Pros:**
     - Very easy to learn and fast to develop with.
     - A large ecosystem of libraries and tools.
     - Suitable for prototyping and scripting tasks.
   - **Cons:**
     - Not as fast or efficient as C++ or C# for heavy system tasks.
     - Less native support for certain low-level operations, though this can be mitigated with native extensions.

### 4. **Rust**
   - **Why:** Rust is a systems programming language that has been gaining popularity for performance-critical applications. It’s designed to be memory safe while offering control over system resources, which is useful for creating optimization tools.
   - **Pros:**
     - Memory safety without a garbage collector.
     - High performance similar to C++.
     - Strong concurrency support.
   - **Cons:**
     - Steep learning curve.
     - Newer language, meaning fewer resources and examples than C++ or C#.

### 5. **Go (Golang)**
   - **Why:** Go is a relatively easy language to learn, and it’s very fast when it comes to concurrency and networking. Although Go doesn’t have direct access to Windows internals like C++ or C#, you can still use it for specific tasks such as optimizing network usage or automating system cleanup.
   - **Pros:**
     - Fast to develop with and easy to maintain.
     - Excellent concurrency support.
   - **Cons:**
     - Limited access to low-level Windows APIs.
     - Less suited for deep system-level optimizations.

### Conclusion:
For building a full-fledged Windows performance optimization tool like Lasso, **C++** and **C#** are the top choices, with **C++** being better for deeper, more efficient optimizations and **C#** offering easier development and maintenance. If you’re just starting or want to quickly prototype, **Python** could be a good choice, though it won’t offer the same performance as C++ or C#.
