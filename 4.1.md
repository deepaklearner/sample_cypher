Handling large data loads like 8 million rows in batches (25k at a time) from MySQL does raise valid concerns about potential connection drops or timeouts. Here’s how you can structure your code for **resilience and retries**.

---

### 🔧 **Answers to Your Questions:**

#### 1. **Is creating the connection in `__init__` good practice?**

**Not ideal for long-running jobs like yours.**
If the connection is established once in `__init__`, it could easily timeout or disconnect before your entire job is done. A better approach is to **create and manage the connection inside your batch-processing loop**, or at least have reconnection logic built in.

### ✅ **Recommended Approach**

#### A. Use `retry` mechanism for both connection and query execution

Here’s a robust pattern:

```python
import mysql.connector
from mysql.connector import Error
import time

class MySQLBatchReader:
    def __init__(self, config, batch_size=25000, max_retries=3, retry_wait=5):
        self.config = config
        self.batch_size = batch_size
        self.max_retries = max_retries
        self.retry_wait = retry_wait
        self.connection = None
        self.cursor = None

    def connect(self):
        retries = 0
        while retries < self.max_retries:
            try:
                self.connection = mysql.connector.connect(**self.config)
                self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()
                print("Connected to MySQL")
                return
            except Error as e:
                print(f"Connection failed: {e}. Retrying in {self.retry_wait} seconds...")
                retries += 1
                time.sleep(self.retry_wait)
        raise Exception("Failed to connect after retries")

    def disconnect(self):
        if self.cursor:
            self.cursor.close()
        if self.connection:
            self.connection.close()
        print("Disconnected from MySQL")

    def read_batches(self, query):
        self.connect()
        offset = 0

        while True:
            batch_query = f"{query} LIMIT {self.batch_size} OFFSET {offset}"
            retries = 0
            while retries < self.max_retries:
                try:
                    self.cursor.execute(batch_query)
                    rows = self.cursor.fetchall()
                    if not rows:
                        return  # Done
                    yield rows
                    offset += self.batch_size
                    break
                except Error as e:
                    print(f"Query failed: {e}. Retrying in {self.retry_wait} seconds...")
                    retries += 1
                    time.sleep(self.retry_wait)
                    self.connect()  # Try reconnecting
        self.disconnect()
```

#### Usage:

```python
config = {
    'host': 'localhost',
    'user': 'youruser',
    'password': 'yourpass',
    'database': 'yourdb'
}

reader = MySQLBatchReader(config)
query = "SELECT * FROM your_table ORDER BY id"

for batch in reader.read_batches(query):
    process(batch)
```

### 🧠 Best Practices Summary

| Aspect                   | Recommendation                                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Connection in `__init__` | ❌ Avoid for long jobs; better to reconnect as needed |
| Retry Logic              | ✅ Yes, wrap both connection and execution            |
| Batch Size               | ✅ 25k is reasonable for most cases                   |
| Disconnection Recovery   | ✅ Catch exceptions, reconnect, and retry             |
| Cursor Scope             | Keep inside the class, recreate if needed            |
