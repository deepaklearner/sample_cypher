1.1 I have two tables eservice_data(key entitle_name and entitle_source) and entitlement_master (key entitle_name and platform).
They key coulumns are entitle_name and entitle_source

entitlement_master has 8.8 million rows
eservice_data has 213k rows

entitle_source and platform are same data.

How to find how many records from table eservice_data having matching keys in entitlement_master. Considering the huge size of entitlement_master
