You're already batching your query with `SKIP`/`LIMIT`, which works fine for general pagination. But to ensure **uniqueness of `globalID`** across all batches‚Äîespecially when duplicates might span multiple batches‚Äîthere's a key challenge: Neo4j‚Äôs `SKIP`/`LIMIT` operates after filtering and ordering, so it doesn‚Äôt inherently remember what was in previous batches.

Here‚Äôs how to **modify your query to ensure only one User per unique `globalID` is returned**, while also allowing batching:

### ‚úÖ Suggested Approach

Use **`DISTINCT` on `globalID`** and **`collect()` + `head()`** trick to pick one unique node per globalID, and then extract employeeNumber from that.

```cypher
MATCH (u:User)
WHERE u.managerid IS NOT NULL AND ("Employee" IN labels(u) OR "Contractor" IN labels(u))
WITH u.globalID AS gid, collect(u)[0] AS u  // pick just one user per unique globalID
// Now traverse reporting structure
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*1..15]->(m:User)
WITH u, COLLECT(DISTINCT m.employeeNumber) AS manager_ids
RETURN u.employeeNumber AS EmployeeID,
       SIZE(manager_ids) AS ManagerLevel,
       manager_ids AS manager_levels
ORDER BY u.employeeNumber
SKIP {offset} LIMIT {batch_size}
```

### üîç Explanation

- `WITH u.globalID AS gid, collect(u)[0] AS u`: Groups by `globalID`, and selects the first user node per group.
- This ensures even if the same `globalID` appears in multiple batches, only **one instance will ever be returned**.
- This works with batching, because you're grouping before pagination.

### üß† Caveats

- The user node selected per `globalID` is arbitrary (whichever appears first). If you want to **prefer one** (e.g., the most recently updated), you can modify the `collect()` logic with `ORDER BY` inside an `apoc.agg.*` function or use `ORDER BY` before `collect`.

Let me know if you'd like to include sorting preferences or support deeper deduplication logic (like preferring Employees over Contractors).
