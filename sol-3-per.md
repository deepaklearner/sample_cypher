Yes, we can optimize this process using Python, pandas, and numpy to reduce the load on Neo4j. Here's an approach to break down the process:

1. Fetch data in batches from Neo4j
2. Process the data using pandas
3. Calculate levels and manager information
4. Store the results

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Neo4j connection
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

def fetch_data(tx, offset, batch_size):
    query = """
    MATCH (u:User) 
    WHERE u.managerid IS NOT NULL 
    AND ("Employee" IN labels(u) OR "Contractor" IN labels(u))
    OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*1..15]->(m:User)
    OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:HAS_ATTRIBUTE]->(n:Name)
    OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:HAS_ATTRIBUTE]->(w:WorkEmail)
    WITH u, COLLECT(DISTINCT {
        managerid: m.employeeNumber,
        manager_fname: n.givenName,
        manager_lname: n.familyName,
        manager_work_email: w.email
    }) AS managers
    RETURN u.employeeNumber AS employeeid, managers
    ORDER BY u.employeeNumber
    SKIP $offset LIMIT $batch_size
    """
    result = tx.run(query, offset=offset, batch_size=batch_size)
    return [dict(record) for record in result]

def process_batch(batch):
    df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
    
    def process_managers(managers):
        level = min(len(managers), 15) + 1
        manager_data = {f'L{i+1}managerid': None for i in range(15)}
        manager_data.update({f'L{i+1}managerFirstName': None for i in range(15)})
        manager_data.update({f'L{i+1}managerLastName': None for i in range(15)})
        manager_data.update({f'L{i+1}managerEmail': None for i in range(15)})
        
        for i, manager in enumerate(managers[:15]):
            manager_data[f'L{i+1}managerid'] = manager['managerid']
            manager_data[f'L{i+1}managerFirstName'] = manager['manager_fname']
            manager_data[f'L{i+1}managerLastName'] = manager['manager_lname']
            manager_data[f'L{i+1}managerEmail'] = manager['manager_work_email']
        
        return pd.Series({'Level': level, **manager_data})
    
    result = df.apply(lambda row: process_managers(row['managers']), axis=1)
    result['employeeid'] = df['employeeid']
    result['managerid'] = result['L1managerid']
    
    return result

def process_all_data():
    offset = 0
    batch_size = 1000
    all_results = []
    
    with driver.session() as session:
        while True:
            batch = session.read_transaction(fetch_data, offset, batch_size)
            if not batch:
                break
            
            result = process_batch(batch)
            all_results.append(result)
            
            offset += batch_size
    
    final_result = pd.concat(all_results, ignore_index=True)
    return final_result

# Run the process
final_df = process_all_data()

# Save to CSV or further processing
final_df.to_csv('employee_hierarchy.csv', index=False)
```

This approach offers several advantages:

1. It fetches data in batches, reducing memory usage and load on Neo4j[1][5].
2. It uses pandas for efficient data processing, which is faster for large datasets[1][5].
3. The level calculation and manager information extraction are done in Python, offloading this work from Neo4j[4].
4. It allows for easy extension to handle more levels if needed.
5. The results can be easily saved to a CSV file or further processed as needed[5].

This method should significantly reduce the load on Neo4j while still providing the same results as the original query. The batch size can be adjusted based on your system's capabilities and the size of your dataset[6].
