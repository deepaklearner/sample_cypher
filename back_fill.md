how to backfill a column using bfill


df['combinedNetwork'] = np.where(
    df['userType'].str.upper() == 'CONTRACTOR',
    df[['networkAccess', 'division']].bfill(axis=1).iloc[:, 0],
    df['division']
)



This line of code is used to create a new column in the DataFrame `df` called `'combinedNetwork'`. It uses the `numpy.where()` function to apply a conditional logic to determine the values for this new column based on the value in the `'userType'` column.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

### 1. **`np.where()` function:**
   - This is a conditional function from the `numpy` library that works like an **if-else** statement.
   - The syntax is: `np.where(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)`
     - `condition`: the condition to evaluate.
     - `value_if_true`: the value to return when the condition is true.
     - `value_if_false`: the value to return when the condition is false.

### 2. **The condition:**
   - `df['userType'].str.upper() == 'CONTRACTOR'`
     - This condition checks if the `'userType'` column (which presumably contains the role/type of the user, e.g., "Contractor", "Employee", etc.) is equal to `'CONTRACTOR'` in uppercase.
     - The `.str.upper()` function is used to convert all the entries in `'userType'` to uppercase before comparing to `'CONTRACTOR'`, ensuring the condition is case-insensitive.
     - The result is a boolean Series (`True` for rows where `'userType'` is `'CONTRACTOR'`, and `False` otherwise).

### 3. **If the condition is true:**
   - `df[['networkAccess', 'division']].bfill(axis=1).iloc[:, 0]`
     - This part is executed when the `'userType'` is `'CONTRACTOR'`.
     - `df[['networkAccess', 'division']]` selects the columns `'networkAccess'` and `'division'`.
     - `.bfill(axis=1)` performs **backward filling** (or "backfilling") across each row (i.e., if a value in `'networkAccess'` is missing, it will take the value from `'division'` if present).
     - `.iloc[:, 0]` selects the first column from the result after backfilling, which will be either `'networkAccess'` or `'division'` (depending on which one had a non-null value after backfilling).
     - The result is the first non-null value between `'networkAccess'` and `'division'` for contractors.

### 4. **If the condition is false:**
   - `df['division']`
     - This part is executed when the `'userType'` is not `'CONTRACTOR'` (i.e., for any other user type).
     - In this case, the value from the `'division'` column is directly used.

### 5. **Assignment:**
   - The result of the `np.where()` function is assigned to the new column `'combinedNetwork'` in the `df` DataFrame.

### **Summary:**
- For rows where `'userType'` is `'CONTRACTOR'`, the `'combinedNetwork'` column will be filled with the first non-null value between `'networkAccess'` and `'division'` (with backfilling).
- For all other `'userType'` values, `'combinedNetwork'` will just take the value from the `'division'` column.

### Example:

| userType  | networkAccess | division | combinedNetwork |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------------|
| CONTRACTOR| A             | NULL     | A               |
| CONTRACTOR| NULL           | B        | B               |
| EMPLOYEE  | C             | D        | D               |
| EMPLOYEE  | NULL           | E        | E               |

In this example:
- For the first row, `'userType'` is `'CONTRACTOR'`, and `'networkAccess'` is `'A'` (non-null), so `'combinedNetwork'` will be `'A'`.
- For the second row, `'userType'` is `'CONTRACTOR'`, but `'networkAccess'` is null, so `'combinedNetwork'` will be filled with `'B'` (from `'division'` after backfilling).
- For the third and fourth rows, where the `'userType'` is not `'CONTRACTOR'`, `'combinedNetwork'` will be filled with the values from `'division'`.
