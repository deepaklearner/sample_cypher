1. In my project at CVS Health, I am working in a project where we are inserting all the data from mysql db to neo4j related to IAM. As of now this data which contains all details about employees, contractors of the company, their access and their accounts across different domains.

I want to understand, how this data might be used by different teams?

2. how this data will be used by different teams? give me some examples as they have asked to create a rest api for neo4j using fast api
