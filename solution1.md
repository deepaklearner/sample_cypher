Take inspiration from above cypher and helo me to write a new cypher query to create a report with below columns.

Sample report with sample data:
| employeeNumber | managerid | Level | L1managerid | L2managerid | L3managerid | L4managerid |
|----------------|-----------|-------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 2000001        | 2000001   | 1     | 2000001     |             |             |             |
| 2000002        | 2000001   | 2     | 2000001     |             |             |             |
| 2000003        | 2000002   | 3     | 2000002     | 2000001     |             |             |
| 2000004        | 2000003   | 4     | 2000003     | 2000002     | 2000001     |             |


        MATCH (employee:User)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (employee)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L1:User)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (L1)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L2:User)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (L2)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L3:User)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (L3)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L4:User)
        RETURN 
        employee.employeeNumber AS employeeNumber,
        employee.managerid AS managerid,
        CASE
            WHEN L4 IS NOT NULL THEN 4
            WHEN L3 IS NOT NULL THEN 3
            WHEN L2 IS NOT NULL THEN 2
            WHEN L1 IS NOT NULL THEN 1
            ELSE 0
        END AS Level,
        L1.employeeNumber AS L1managerid,
        L2.employeeNumber AS L2managerid,
        L3.employeeNumber AS L3managerid,
        L4.employeeNumber AS L4managerid
        ORDER BY employee.employeeNumber

for all 4 rows Level came as 4

The issue with the `Level` calculation in the query is that it doesn't stop checking for higher levels once it finds a lower-level match. To ensure that `Level` is set based on the first non-null manager level, let's modify the logic to determine the correct level based on the hierarchy depth.

Here's the corrected query:

```cypher
MATCH (employee:User)
OPTIONAL MATCH (employee)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L1:User)
OPTIONAL MATCH (L1)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L2:User)
OPTIONAL MATCH (L2)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L3:User)
OPTIONAL MATCH (L3)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L4:User)
RETURN 
  employee.employeeNumber AS employeeNumber,
  employee.managerid AS managerid,
  CASE
    WHEN L1 IS NOT NULL AND L2 IS NULL THEN 1
    WHEN L2 IS NOT NULL AND L3 IS NULL THEN 2
    WHEN L3 IS NOT NULL AND L4 IS NULL THEN 3
    WHEN L4 IS NOT NULL THEN 4
    ELSE 0
  END AS Level,
  L1.employeeNumber AS L1managerid,
  L2.employeeNumber AS L2managerid,
  L3.employeeNumber AS L3managerid,
  L4.employeeNumber AS L4managerid
ORDER BY employee.employeeNumber
```

### Explanation of Changes:

- The `CASE` statement now checks each level in a sequential manner:
  - **Level 1**: `L1` is non-null and `L2` is null (indicating that thereâ€™s only one level in the hierarchy).
  - **Level 2**: `L2` is non-null and `L3` is null.
  - **Level 3**: `L3` is non-null and `L4` is null.
  - **Level 4**: `L4` is non-null (indicating four levels in the hierarchy).

This should correctly populate the `Level` column based on the depth of the reporting hierarchy. Each employee's level will reflect the first valid non-null manager level.

Next try:

        MATCH (employee:User)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (employee)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L1:User)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (L1)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L2:User)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (L2)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L3:User)
        OPTIONAL MATCH (L3)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(L4:User)
        RETURN 
        employee.employeeNumber AS employeeNumber,
        employee.managerid AS managerid,
        coalesce(
            CASE WHEN L4 IS NOT NULL THEN 4 END,
            CASE WHEN L3 IS NOT NULL THEN 3 END,
            CASE WHEN L2 IS NOT NULL THEN 2 END,
            CASE WHEN L1 IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END,
            0
        ) AS Level,
        L1.employeeNumber AS L1managerid,
        L2.employeeNumber AS L2managerid,
        L3.employeeNumber AS L3managerid,
        L4.employeeNumber AS L4managerid
        ORDER BY employee.employeeNumber
