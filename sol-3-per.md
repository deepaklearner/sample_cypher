Yes, we can optimize this process using Python, pandas, and numpy to reduce the load on Neo4j. Here's an approach to break down the process:

1. Fetch data in batches from Neo4j
2. Process the data using pandas
3. Calculate levels and manager information
4. Store the results

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

# Neo4j connection
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7687", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

def fetch_data(tx, offset, batch_size):
    query = """
    MATCH (u:User) 
    WHERE u.managerid IS NOT NULL 
    AND ("Employee" IN labels(u) OR "Contractor" IN labels(u))
    OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*1..15]->(m:User)
    OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:HAS_ATTRIBUTE]->(n:Name)
    OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:HAS_ATTRIBUTE]->(w:WorkEmail)
    WITH u, COLLECT(DISTINCT {
        managerid: m.employeeNumber,
        manager_fname: n.givenName,
        manager_lname: n.familyName,
        manager_work_email: w.email
    }) AS managers
    RETURN u.employeeNumber AS employeeid, managers
    ORDER BY u.employeeNumber
    SKIP $offset LIMIT $batch_size
    """
    result = tx.run(query, offset=offset, batch_size=batch_size)
    return [dict(record) for record in result]

def process_batch(batch):
    df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
    
    def process_managers(managers):
        level = min(len(managers), 15) + 1
        manager_data = {f'L{i+1}managerid': None for i in range(15)}
        manager_data.update({f'L{i+1}managerFirstName': None for i in range(15)})
        manager_data.update({f'L{i+1}managerLastName': None for i in range(15)})
        manager_data.update({f'L{i+1}managerEmail': None for i in range(15)})
        
        for i, manager in enumerate(managers[:15]):
            manager_data[f'L{i+1}managerid'] = manager['managerid']
            manager_data[f'L{i+1}managerFirstName'] = manager['manager_fname']
            manager_data[f'L{i+1}managerLastName'] = manager['manager_lname']
            manager_data[f'L{i+1}managerEmail'] = manager['manager_work_email']
        
        return pd.Series({'Level': level, **manager_data})
    
    result = df.apply(lambda row: process_managers(row['managers']), axis=1)
    result['employeeid'] = df['employeeid']
    result['managerid'] = result['L1managerid']
    
    return result

def process_all_data():
    offset = 0
    batch_size = 1000
    all_results = []
    
    with driver.session() as session:
        while True:
            batch = session.read_transaction(fetch_data, offset, batch_size)
            if not batch:
                break
            
            result = process_batch(batch)
            all_results.append(result)
            
            offset += batch_size
    
    final_result = pd.concat(all_results, ignore_index=True)
    return final_result

# Run the process
final_df = process_all_data()

# Save to CSV or further processing
final_df.to_csv('employee_hierarchy.csv', index=False)
```

This approach offers several advantages:

1. It fetches data in batches, reducing memory usage and load on Neo4j[1][5].
2. It uses pandas for efficient data processing, which is faster for large datasets[1][5].
3. The level calculation and manager information extraction are done in Python, offloading this work from Neo4j[4].
4. It allows for easy extension to handle more levels if needed.
5. The results can be easily saved to a CSV file or further processed as needed[5].

This method should significantly reduce the load on Neo4j while still providing the same results as the original query. The batch size can be adjusted based on your system's capabilities and the size of your dataset[6].

i want to optimize this part more ... """query = """

Certainly! We can optimize this query further by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts. This approach will reduce the complexity of each query and potentially improve performance. Here's an optimized version:

```python
def fetch_users(tx, offset, batch_size):
    query = """
    MATCH (u:User) 
    WHERE u.managerid IS NOT NULL 
    AND ("Employee" IN labels(u) OR "Contractor" IN labels(u))
    RETURN u.employeeNumber AS employeeid, u.managerid AS managerid
    ORDER BY u.employeeNumber
    SKIP $offset LIMIT $batch_size
    """
    result = tx.run(query, offset=offset, batch_size=batch_size)
    return [dict(record) for record in result]

def fetch_manager_chain(tx, employeeid):
    query = """
    MATCH (u:User {employeeNumber: $employeeid})
    MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*0..15]->(m:User)
    OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:HAS_ATTRIBUTE]->(n:Name)
    OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:HAS_ATTRIBUTE]->(w:WorkEmail)
    RETURN m.employeeNumber AS managerid, 
           n.givenName AS manager_fname, 
           n.familyName AS manager_lname, 
           w.email AS manager_work_email
    ORDER BY length((u)-[:REPORTS_TO*]->(m))
    """
    result = tx.run(query, employeeid=employeeid)
    return [dict(record) for record in result]

def process_all_data():
    offset = 0
    batch_size = 1000
    all_results = []
    
    with driver.session() as session:
        while True:
            users = session.read_transaction(fetch_users, offset, batch_size)
            if not users:
                break
            
            for user in users:
                managers = session.read_transaction(fetch_manager_chain, user['employeeid'])
                user['managers'] = managers
            
            result = process_batch(users)
            all_results.append(result)
            
            offset += batch_size
    
    final_result = pd.concat(all_results, ignore_index=True)
    return final_result
```

This optimized version offers several improvements:

1. It separates the user fetching and manager chain fetching into two distinct queries. This allows for more granular control and potentially better query optimization by Neo4j.

2. The `fetch_users` function now only retrieves the basic user information (employeeid and managerid) for the batch. This reduces the amount of data transferred in the initial query.

3. The `fetch_manager_chain` function is called for each user individually. This allows for better use of indexes and could potentially be faster, especially for users with fewer levels of management.

4. By using `MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*0..15]->(m:User)` instead of `OPTIONAL MATCH`, we ensure we're only processing actual managers, which could reduce the amount of data processed.

5. The `ORDER BY length((u)-[:REPORTS_TO*]->(m))` in the `fetch_manager_chain` query ensures that the managers are returned in the correct order (direct manager first, then their manager, and so on).

6. This approach allows for easy parallelization if needed. You could process multiple users' manager chains concurrently using Python's multiprocessing or concurrent.futures modules.

Remember to adjust the `process_batch` function to work with the new data structure where each user has a 'managers' list instead of a single 'managers' field.

This optimized version should reduce the load on Neo4j by breaking down the complex query into simpler, more manageable parts. It also provides more flexibility for further optimizations if needed.
