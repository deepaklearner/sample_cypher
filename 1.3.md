Perfect â€” yes, itâ€™s much more efficient to do that logic using **vectorized operations with pandas**, rather than looping over rows. Here's how to efficiently validate owners at the **DataFrame level**, and separate valid and invalid rows in bulk:

## âœ… Vectorized Owner Validation (Improved `process_batch()`)

```python
def process_batch(df):
    # Step 1: Collect all unique owner IDs
    owner_columns = ['owner1', 'owner2', 'owner3']
    all_owner_ids = pd.unique(df[owner_columns].values.ravel())
    all_owner_ids = set(filter(None, all_owner_ids))  # remove None or empty

    # Step 2: Validate against Neo4j in bulk
    valid_owners = get_valid_owners(all_owner_ids)

    # Step 3: Create mask for each owner column
    is_owner1_valid = df['owner1'].isin(valid_owners) | df['owner1'].isnull()
    is_owner2_valid = df['owner2'].isin(valid_owners) | df['owner2'].isnull()
    is_owner3_valid = df['owner3'].isin(valid_owners) | df['owner3'].isnull()

    # Step 4: Identify fully valid rows
    valid_mask = is_owner1_valid & is_owner2_valid & is_owner3_valid

    valid_df = df[valid_mask].copy()
    invalid_df = df[~valid_mask].copy()

    # Step 5: Optional â€” collect which owners were invalid for each row
    def get_invalid_owners(row):
        return [o for o in [row['owner1'], row['owner2'], row['owner3']] if o and o not in valid_owners]

    if not invalid_df.empty:
        invalid_df['invalid_owners'] = invalid_df.apply(get_invalid_owners, axis=1)

    # Step 6: Process valid rows in Neo4j
    with neo4j_driver.session() as session:
        for _, row in valid_df.iterrows():  # Neo4j still needs row-by-row writes unless batching with UNWIND
            session.write_transaction(create_entitlement_and_links, row, valid_owners)

    return invalid_df
```

## ðŸ§  Why This Is Better

- Vectorized `.isin()` checks all rows in a column at once.
- No `for` loop is used for validation logic.
- Use `.apply()` only once, and only on the small subset of invalid rows.
- Still allows you to return a complete error report with `invalid_owners`.

Would you like the Neo4j write part to also be vectorized with `UNWIND` to reduce transaction calls?
