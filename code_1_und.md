This Python function `create_graph_for_Department_hierarchy` is designed to create or update a graph in a Neo4j database based on the department hierarchy data stored in a `FeatureDF` DataFrame. It performs several operations to ensure the department structure, user-manager relationships, and relevant properties are correctly represented in the graph.

Let’s break it down step-by-step:

### 1. **Initial Check for Non-Empty DataFrame**
```python
if len(FeatureDF) > 0:
```
The function first checks if the input `FeatureDF` DataFrame is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one record). If it’s empty, the function won’t proceed to run the Neo4j query.

### 2. **Cypher Query Definition**
```python
query_depthierarchy = """
UNWIND $rows AS row
...
"""
```
The Cypher query is defined as a multi-line string within the function. This query will be run on the Neo4j database, where:

- `UNWIND $rows AS row`: This takes the rows of the DataFrame (`FeatureDF`) and iterates over each row one by one. The `$rows` parameter will be passed from the Python code, and each row will be processed as a `row` in Cypher.
  
### 3. **Creating/Updating the Department Node**
```cypher
MERGE (dept:Department {departmentCode: row.currentcode})
SET dept.department = row.currentdesc,
    dept.deptLevel = row.currentlvl
WITH row, dept
```
- **MERGE**: If a department node already exists with the `departmentCode` matching the `row.currentcode`, it won't create a new one. If it doesn’t exist, it will create a new `Department` node.
- **SET**: It updates or sets properties on the department node, including:
  - `department`: The department’s name (`row.currentdesc`).
  - `deptLevel`: The department’s level in the hierarchy (`row.currentlvl`).

### 4. **Handling Existing Relationships**
```cypher
OPTIONAL MATCH (:User)-[r_has:MANAGES]->(dept)
OPTIONAL MATCH (dept)-[r_report_to:REPORTS_TO]->(:Department)
MATCH (globalid:GlobalIdentifierCounter)
DELETE r_has, r_report_to
```
- **OPTIONAL MATCH**: This finds any existing relationships (if any) between:
  - `User` nodes who manage the `Department` node (via `MANAGES` relationship).
  - `Department` nodes that the current department reports to (via `REPORTS_TO` relationship).
- **DELETE**: Any existing `MANAGES` and `REPORTS_TO` relationships are deleted. This ensures that if any changes are made (e.g., a new manager or parent department), previous relationships are removed before new ones are created.

### 5. **Creating Parent-Child Department Relationship**
```cypher
FOREACH (x IN CASE WHEN row.parentcode <> "DNE" THEN [1] END |
    MERGE (dept2:Department {departmentCode: row.parentcode})
    ON CREATE SET dept2.department = row.parentdesc,
                  dept2.deptLevel = row.parentlvl
    MERGE (dept)-[:REPORTS_TO]->(dept2)
)
```
- **FOREACH**: This block executes only when the `parentcode` is not `"DNE"` (likely meaning "Do Not Exist"). It creates or updates the parent department (`dept2`):
  - **MERGE**: It checks if a department with the `parentcode` exists and, if not, creates it.
  - **ON CREATE SET**: If the parent department is created, it sets its `department` name and `deptLevel`.
  - **MERGE**: It creates a `REPORTS_TO` relationship from the current department (`dept`) to its parent (`dept2`), establishing a parent-child relationship in the hierarchy.

### 6. **Creating User-Manager Relationship**
```cypher
FOREACH (x IN CASE WHEN row.current_manager <> "DNE" AND row.is_manager_exist_in_INT5043 = 'Y' THEN [1] END |
    MERGE (usr:User {employeeNumber: row.current_manager})
    ON CREATE SET usr.userProfileID = apoc.create.uuid(),
                  usr.globalID = toString(toInteger(globalid.lastAssignedCounterValue) + 1),
                  globalid.lastExecutionDate = localdatetime(),
                  globalid.lastAssignedCounterValue = toString(toInteger(globalid.lastAssignedCounterValue) + 1)
    MERGE (usr)-[:MANAGES]->(dept)
)
```
- **FOREACH**: This block runs if the `current_manager` is not `"DNE"` and if `is_manager_exist_in_INT5043` is `'Y'`, indicating that a valid manager exists for the department.
- **MERGE**: It either finds an existing `User` node with the `employeeNumber` matching `row.current_manager` or creates a new one if it doesn’t exist.
- **ON CREATE SET**: If a new `User` node is created, it sets:
  - `userProfileID`: A new unique identifier created using `apoc.create.uuid()`.
  - `globalID`: A unique global identifier is created using a counter (`globalid.lastAssignedCounterValue`), which is updated.
  - `globalid.lastExecutionDate`: The timestamp of the last execution.
  - `globalid.lastAssignedCounterValue`: The updated counter value.
- **MERGE**: It creates a `MANAGES` relationship from the user (`usr`) to the department (`dept`), indicating that the user is the manager of the department.

### 7. **Return Count of Processed Rows**
```cypher
RETURN COUNT(*)
```
At the end of the query, it returns the count of rows processed. This helps to monitor how many rows have been handled in the operation.

### 8. **Executing the Query**
```python
self.neo4j_session.run(query_depthierarchy, rows=FeatureDF.to_dict('records'))
```
Finally, the function sends the Cypher query to Neo4j through the `neo4j_session`. The DataFrame `FeatureDF` is converted into a list of dictionaries (`FeatureDF.to_dict('records')`), where each dictionary represents a row of the DataFrame. This is passed as the parameter `rows` to the Cypher query for processing.

### Key Components:
- **MERGE**: Ensures idempotent operations (either matching an existing node/relationship or creating new ones).
- **FOREACH + CASE**: Executes conditional logic in Cypher.
- **User and Department Nodes**: Updates or creates nodes representing departments and users.
- **Relationships**: Manages relationships like `REPORTS_TO` (parent-child department) and `MANAGES` (user-manager).
- **Global Identifier Management**: Ensures unique global IDs are assigned to users and increments a counter.

### Summary:
This function processes the department hierarchy and manager relationships in the `FeatureDF` DataFrame and updates or creates the corresponding nodes and relationships in the Neo4j graph. It handles complex cases like checking for existing nodes, managing relationships, and updating counters for global identifiers.
