To address the problem you've outlined, you can follow the following Cypher approach. I'll break it down into the steps you mentioned:

### 1. **Reading data from MySQL into a dataframe (`df`), then using `UNWIND` to read rows into Neo4j**:
We'll assume that your MySQL dataframe (`df`) is being transferred into a list of rows. The list will have the columns `CVSResourceid`, `AetnaResourceid`, `cvsnetworkid`, and `cid`.

### 2. **Updating existing nodes if there is any difference**:
We will check if there are any existing nodes with values that differ from the data in the MySQL `df` and update them if necessary.

### 3. **Create AetnaNetworkIdentifier node**:
If no AetnaNetworkIdentifier node exists for the given `AetnaResourceid`, we'll create it.

### 4. **Create relationship**:
We will then create a relationship between `User` nodes and the newly created or existing `AetnaNetworkIdentifier`.

Here's the Cypher query:

```cypher
// Assume df is already available as a list of rows with the required data
UNWIND $data AS row

// Match the existing User node based on CVSResourceid (which maps to employeeNumber in Neo4j)
MATCH (u:User {employeeNumber: row.CVSResourceid})

// Check if the properties of the User node need to be updated, and update if necessary
WITH u, row
WHERE u.aetnaresourceid <> row.AetnaResourceid OR u.cvsnetworkid <> row.cvsnetworkid OR u.cid <> row.cid

// Update the properties in the User node if there's any change
SET u.aetnaresourceid = row.AetnaResourceid,
    u.cvsnetworkid = row.cvsnetworkid,
    u.cid = row.cid

// Create the AetnaNetworkIdentifier node if it doesn't already exist
MERGE (a:AetnaNetworkIdentifier {networkid: row.AetnaResourceid})
SET a.uid = row.AetnaResourceid  // Or any other property you want to set for AetnaNetworkIdentifier

// Create the relationship between the User and the AetnaNetworkIdentifier node
MERGE (u)-[r:HAS_AETNA_ID]->(a)
SET r.assigned_date = timestamp()  // Set the current timestamp for the assigned_date property

RETURN u, a, r
```

### Explanation:

1. **UNWIND `$data AS row`**:
   - The data coming from MySQL (as a list of rows) is unpacked. `$data` should be the list you pass when running the Cypher query, and each row represents a single record (with values like `CVSResourceid`, `AetnaResourceid`, `cvsnetworkid`, and `cid`).

2. **MATCH (u:User {employeeNumber: row.CVSResourceid})**:
   - We match the `User` node in Neo4j based on the `employeeNumber` property, which corresponds to `CVSResourceid` from MySQL.

3. **WHERE clause**:
   - The `WHERE` clause checks if any of the properties (`aetnaresourceid`, `cvsnetworkid`, `cid`) in the `User` node are different from the data in `row`. If any are different, the update happens.

4. **SET u.aetnaresourceid = row.AetnaResourceid, u.cvsnetworkid = row.cvsnetworkid, u.cid = row.cid**:
   - This updates the properties of the `User` node.

5. **MERGE (a:AetnaNetworkIdentifier {networkid: row.AetnaResourceid})**:
   - This ensures that the `AetnaNetworkIdentifier` node exists. If it doesn't exist, it will be created with the given `networkid`.

6. **SET a.uid = row.AetnaResourceid**:
   - This sets the `uid` property of the `AetnaNetworkIdentifier` node. You can modify this based on your exact requirements.

7. **MERGE (u)-[r:HAS_AETNA_ID]->(a)**:
   - This ensures that there is a relationship of type `HAS_AETNA_ID` between the `User` and `AetnaNetworkIdentifier` nodes. If the relationship doesn't exist, it will be created.

8. **SET r.assigned_date = timestamp()**:
   - Sets the `assigned_date` property on the relationship to the current timestamp.

9. **RETURN u, a, r**:
   - This returns the `User`, `AetnaNetworkIdentifier`, and relationship for verification.

### Notes:
- The `$data` placeholder is where you pass the list of rows from the MySQL dataframe.
- The `timestamp()` function provides the current Unix timestamp, which is used to set the `assigned_date`.
- The `MERGE` ensures that the `AetnaNetworkIdentifier` and the relationship are either created or matched based on the properties.
