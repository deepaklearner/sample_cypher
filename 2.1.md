The error you're encountering:

> `Node already exists with label Name and property computedformattedName`

…indicates that **your Cypher query is trying to create a `Name` node with a `computedformattedName` that already exists**, violating the **unique constraint** on `Name.computedformattedName`.

Let's break this down and see how to **fix or defend against this error.**

---

### ⚠️ Likely Problem

You're using this part of the query to `MERGE`:

```cypher
MERGE (Name_node:Name { computedformattedName: row.concat_attr_Name })
```

This `MERGE` says:

> "If a `Name` node with this `computedformattedName` does not exist, create one."

But here's the **catch**:
If a node with that `computedformattedName` already exists, **but with different case or whitespace** (or if a previous operation already created it), and Neo4j thinks it's the same but your earlier logic is trying to update/replace it — you can run into constraint conflicts, especially if the merge is being attempted **after deleting a relationship** that pointed to an old node (but not the node itself).

---

### ✅ Fixes & Suggestions

#### ✅ Option 1: Change `MERGE` to `MATCH` + Conditional `CREATE`

First, check if the node exists with that `computedformattedName`, and only create if it doesn't. Like so:

```cypher
WITH row, user_row
OPTIONAL MATCH (existingName:Name { computedformattedName: row.concat_attr_Name })

WITH row, user_row, existingName
CALL {
  WITH row, existingName
  // If it doesn't exist, create
  WITH row WHERE existingName IS NULL
  CREATE (newName:Name {
    computedformattedName: row.concat_attr_Name,
    formattedName: row.fullnameformatted,
    givenName: row.givenName,
    middleName: row.middleName,
    familyName: row.familyName,
    honorificPrefix: row.honorificPrefix,
    honorificSuffix: row.honorificSuffix
  })
  RETURN newName AS Name_node
  UNION
  // If it exists, update
  WITH existingName, row
  SET existingName.formattedName   = row.fullnameformatted,
      existingName.givenName       = row.givenName,
      existingName.middleName      = row.middleName,
      existingName.familyName      = row.familyName,
      existingName.honorificPrefix = row.honorificPrefix,
      existingName.honorificSuffix = row.honorificSuffix
  RETURN existingName AS Name_node
}

MERGE (user_row)-[:HAS_ATTRIBUTE]->(Name_node)
REMOVE Name_node.isTempProperty
```

This makes the creation and update paths **explicit** and avoids hitting the unique constraint unexpectedly.

---

#### ✅ Option 2: Use `ON CREATE SET` / `ON MATCH SET` pattern

If you're sure the `MERGE` is safe **as long as the update is only on creation**, use:

```cypher
MERGE (Name_node:Name { computedformattedName: row.concat_attr_Name })
  ON CREATE SET
    Name_node.formattedName   = row.fullnameformatted,
    Name_node.givenName       = row.givenName,
    Name_node.middleName      = row.middleName,
    Name_node.familyName      = row.familyName,
    Name_node.honorificPrefix = row.honorificPrefix,
    Name_node.honorificSuffix = row.honorificSuffix
  ON MATCH SET
    Name_node.formattedName   = row.fullnameformatted,
    Name_node.givenName       = row.givenName,
    Name_node.middleName      = row.middleName,
    Name_node.familyName      = row.familyName,
    Name_node.honorificPrefix = row.honorificPrefix,
    Name_node.honorificSuffix = row.honorificSuffix
```

This is less robust than Option 1 in detecting actual merge conflict situations caused by intermediate state, but works in many practical cases.

---

### 🧪 Bonus Tip: Defensive Pre-check

Before you do `MERGE`, you could also check:

```cypher
WITH row
OPTIONAL MATCH (n:Name { computedformattedName: row.concat_attr_Name })
WITH row, COUNT(n) AS existing
WHERE existing = 0
MERGE ...
```

This helps avoid merging if the node already exists, letting you log or handle the duplication differently.

---

### Summary

You're getting a constraint error because `MERGE` is trying to create a duplicate `Name` node that violates the uniqueness on `computedformattedName`. Use **MATCH + CREATE** or **defensive checking** to avoid it.

Let me know if you want the entire query rewritten with the safer structure.
