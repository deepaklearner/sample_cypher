If you don't have activity data captured in your Neo4j database, you can still build effective recommendation systems by focusing on the relationships between users, roles, permissions, and resources. Here are some recommendation strategies that do not rely on activity data but still utilize the graph structure:

### 1. **Role-based Recommendations**
   - **Idea**: Recommend roles to a user based on the roles assigned to similar users.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Collaborative Filtering (based on roles)**: Find users who share similar roles and recommend roles that those users have but the current user does not.
     - Example: If users A and B both have roles `admin`, `manager`, and user A also has `developer`, recommend `developer` to user B if they share other roles.
     
     You can use graph algorithms such as **node similarity** or even **community detection** to find groups of users with similar role patterns.

     Example query to find similar users with shared roles:
     ```python
     query = """
     MATCH (u1:User)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(r:Role)<-[:ASSIGNED_TO]-(u2:User)
     WHERE u1.id <> u2.id
     RETURN u1.id AS user1, u2.id AS user2, collect(r.name) AS common_roles
     ORDER BY length(common_roles) DESC
     LIMIT 10
     """
     result = graph.run(query)
     for record in result:
         print(f"User {record['user1']} and User {record['user2']} share roles: {record['common_roles']}")
     ```

### 2. **Permissions-based Recommendations**
   - **Idea**: Recommend permissions to users based on the permissions associated with roles they currently have.
   - **Approach**:
     - Look for permissions that are typically granted to roles a user holds and recommend those permissions if the user does not already have them.
     
     Example: If a user has the `admin` role, they might need permissions for `view_user_data` and `modify_user_data`. If another user has the `admin` role but lacks `modify_user_data`, recommend that permission to them.

     Example query to find recommended permissions based on roles:
     ```python
     query = """
     MATCH (u:User)-[:ASSIGNED_TO]->(r:Role)-[:HAS_PERMISSION]->(p:Permission)
     WHERE u.id = 'user123'  // Replace with actual user ID
     RETURN collect(p.name) AS user_permissions
     """
     result = graph.run(query)
     for record in result:
         print(f"User permissions: {record['user_permissions']}")
     ```

     Then, based on the results, recommend permissions that are frequently linked to the user's existing roles.

### 3. **Graph Proximity-based Recommendations (Content-based)**
   - **Idea**: Recommend resources or roles based on their "closeness" to the user's current roles or resources, without needing activity data.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use **graph algorithms** like **PageRank**, **personalized PageRank**, or **Node Similarity** to identify the most central roles, resources, or permissions in the graph. Then recommend these based on how closely they are related to the user's existing graph.
     - For instance, if a user has the `admin` role, they might be recommended other roles or resources that are frequently linked to `admin`.

     Example using **PageRank**:
     ```python
     query = """
     CALL algo.pageRank.stream('Role', 'HAS_PERMISSION', {iterations:20, dampingFactor:0.85})
     YIELD nodeId, score
     MATCH (r:Role) WHERE id(r) = nodeId
     RETURN r.name AS role, score
     ORDER BY score DESC
     LIMIT 5
     """
     result = graph.run(query)
     for record in result:
         print(f"Recommended role: {record['role']} with score: {record['score']}")
     ```

### 4. **Cluster-based Recommendations (Community Detection)**
   - **Idea**: Group similar users (community detection) and recommend roles/permissions/resources within that group.
   - **Approach**:
     - Use **community detection** algorithms to find clusters of users who share similar role structures or permissions.
     - After detecting these communities, recommend roles or permissions that are common within a user's community but not assigned to them yet.

     Example using **Community Detection**:
     ```python
     query = """
     CALL algo.louvain.stream('User', 'ASSIGNED_TO', {includeIntermediateCommunities:true})
     YIELD nodeId, community
     MATCH (u:User) WHERE id(u) = nodeId
     RETURN u.id AS user, community
     ORDER BY community
     """
     result = graph.run(query)
     for record in result:
         print(f"User {record['user']} belongs to community {record['community']}")
     ```

### 5. **Role Hierarchy Recommendations**
   - **Idea**: Recommend roles that are hierarchical to the current roles.
   - **Approach**:
     - If a user has a `manager` role, recommend the `director` or `executive` roles, assuming that your system includes a hierarchy of roles (e.g., `admin > manager > employee`).
     - You can model role hierarchies by creating relationships like `(:Role)-[:IS_HIERARCHY_OF]->(:Role)`.

     Example query to find higher-level roles:
     ```python
     query = """
     MATCH (r1:Role)-[:IS_HIERARCHY_OF]->(r2:Role)
     WHERE r1.name = 'manager'  // Replace with the user's role
     RETURN r2.name AS recommended_role
     """
     result = graph.run(query)
     for record in result:
         print(f"Recommended role: {record['recommended_role']}")
     ```

### 6. **Permission Grouping Recommendations**
   - **Idea**: Recommend groups of permissions associated with specific roles.
   - **Approach**:
     - If a user has a particular role, recommend a set of permissions typically linked to that role.
     - Example: If a user has the `developer` role, recommend other permissions associated with roles like `testing` or `deployment` that may benefit the user.

     Example query to find permissions linked to a role:
     ```python
     query = """
     MATCH (r:Role)-[:HAS_PERMISSION]->(p:Permission)
     WHERE r.name = 'developer'  // Replace with the actual role
     RETURN collect(p.name) AS permissions
     """
     result = graph.run(query)
     for record in result:
         print(f"Recommended permissions for developer: {record['permissions']}")
     ```

### 7. **Similarity-based Role Recommendations (Content-based)**
   - **Idea**: Recommend roles similar to the ones a user already holds based on the roles' attributes.
   - **Approach**:
     - You can create custom attributes for each role (e.g., the type of access it provides, related permissions, etc.) and find roles with similar attributes to recommend.

### Conclusion:
These ideas can help you build a recommendation system that doesnâ€™t rely on activity data but still provides valuable recommendations based on relationships and graph structures. You can combine these strategies or use them independently to create recommendations based on roles, permissions, resources, and hierarchical relationships. Depending on your needs, you can extend this model further with more specific graph algorithms, personalization techniques, and recommendation metrics.
