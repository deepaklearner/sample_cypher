Ah, I see! You want to retain the backup data for only 7 days in the `glidesupervisorhierachy_backup` table. After the 7-day retention period, any data older than that in the backup table should be deleted.

Here’s how to modify the code:

1. **Backup Data**: When data is backed up to the `glidesupervisorhierachy_backup` table, we add a `BackupTimestamp` (if it doesn't exist) to record the timestamp of the backup.

2. **Delete Old Backup Data**: After the backup, we will delete records from the `glidesupervisorhierachy_backup` table that are older than 7 days based on the `BackupTimestamp`.

### Updated Code with 7-Day Retention in the Backup Table:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pymysql
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Example DataFrame (for illustration, this DataFrame has 109 columns)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    f'column_{i}': range(1, 6) for i in range(1, 109)
})

# Add the column that needs to be renamed for the MySQL table
df['ManagerLevel'] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Sample data for ManagerLevel

# Connect to MySQL using pymysql
conn = pymysql.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    database='yourdb'
)

cursor = conn.cursor()

# Step 1: Get the column names from your MySQL table (ensure the correct order)
cursor.execute("DESCRIBE your_table;")
table_columns = [column[0] for column in cursor.fetchall()]

# Step 2: Create a column mapping to handle the name mismatch (ManagerLevel → level)
column_mapping = {
    'ManagerLevel': 'level',  # Map 'ManagerLevel' in DataFrame to 'level' in MySQL
}

# Make sure the DataFrame columns are in the same order as the table columns, applying any necessary mapping
df_columns = df.columns.tolist()

# Adjust the DataFrame columns according to the mapping (rename 'ManagerLevel' to 'level')
df.rename(columns=column_mapping, inplace=True)

# Now, reorder the DataFrame columns to match the table columns (using the table's column names)
df = df[table_columns]

# Step 3: Generate placeholders for the SQL query based on the number of columns in the table
placeholders = ', '.join(['%s'] * len(table_columns))  # %s repeated for each column

# Prepare the SQL query with dynamically generated placeholders
insert_query = f"INSERT INTO your_table ({', '.join(table_columns)}) VALUES ({placeholders})"

# Step 4: Prepare data for insertion, ensuring the order matches the table's columns
data_to_insert = [tuple(row) for row in df[table_columns].values]

# Step 5: Define a function to backup and delete old backup data
def bkp_tbl_n_delete_data(cursor, table_name, backup_table_name):
    # Step 5.1: Add a BackupTimestamp to backup table if it doesn't exist
    try:
        cursor.execute(f"ALTER TABLE {backup_table_name} ADD COLUMN BackupTimestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP")
    except pymysql.MySQLError as e:
        if "Duplicate column" not in str(e):
            raise e  # Raise other errors

    # Step 5.2: Back up the data to the backup table with the current timestamp
    backup_query = f"INSERT INTO {backup_table_name} SELECT *, NOW() FROM {table_name}"
    cursor.execute(backup_query)
    conn.commit()
    print(f"Data from {table_name} backed up to {backup_table_name}.")
    
    # Step 5.3: Delete backup data older than 7 days based on the BackupTimestamp
    seven_days_ago = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    delete_query = f"DELETE FROM {backup_table_name} WHERE BackupTimestamp < '{seven_days_ago}'"
    cursor.execute(delete_query)
    conn.commit()
    print(f"Backup data older than 7 days deleted from {backup_table_name}.")

# Step 6: Call the function to backup and delete old backup data before inserting new data
bkp_tbl_n_delete_data(cursor, "your_table", "glidesupervisorhierachy_backup")

# Step 7: Execute the query in batches (use executemany for batch inserts)
batch_size = 1000  # Example batch size (adjust as needed)
for start in range(0, len(df), batch_size):
    end = start + batch_size
    batch = data_to_insert[start:end]
    cursor.executemany(insert_query, batch)
    conn.commit()  # Commit the batch insert operation

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
conn.close()
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Backup Timestamp**: 
   - I added a `BackupTimestamp` column in the `glidesupervisorhierachy_backup` table. This column will store the timestamp of when each backup was made.
   - The `ALTER TABLE` query is used to add the `BackupTimestamp` column if it doesn’t already exist. If it exists, it will be ignored (with an error check).

2. **Backup Query**: 
   - The backup query now inserts the current timestamp (`NOW()`) along with the data when backing it up to the `glidesupervisorhierachy_backup` table.

3. **Deleting Data Older Than 7 Days**: 
   - After inserting the data into the backup table, I added a `DELETE` query to remove records from the `glidesupervisorhierachy_backup` table where the `BackupTimestamp` is older than 7 days. The `datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)` calculates the timestamp for 7 days ago.

### Notes:
- Ensure that the `glidesupervisorhierachy_backup` table is large enough to store backups with the added timestamp column.
- You may need to adjust the timestamp format (`strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')`) if your MySQL database uses a different format for timestamps. However, the default format of `NOW()` should work fine for most setups.
- You can adjust the table name (`glidesupervisorhierachy_backup`) and column names if necessary based on your actual schema.
