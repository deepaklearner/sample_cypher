Handle aid for manager

There are some values for managerid which is not employeeNumber but userName property of UserAccount node. UserAccount node is connected to User node with HAS_ATTRIBUTE.

So, if a User node is not found by managerid value then i want to search using userName property of UserAccount node and then reach to the User node. Please add this login in below cypher.

// Collect manager hierarchy up to 4 levels, ensuring no duplicates
OPTIONAL MATCH (m:User {employeeNumber: e.managerid})
WITH e, m, 
     CASE WHEN NOT m.employeeNumber IN managers THEN managers + [m.employeeNumber] ELSE managers END AS managers
WHERE m IS NOT NULL

OPTIONAL MATCH (m2:User {employeeNumber: m.managerid})
WITH e, m2,
     CASE WHEN NOT m2.employeeNumber IN managers THEN managers + [m2.employeeNumber] ELSE managers END AS managers
WHERE m2 IS NOT NULL

OPTIONAL MATCH (m3:User {employeeNumber: m2.managerid})
WITH e, m3,  
     CASE WHEN NOT m3.employeeNumber IN managers THEN managers + [m3.employeeNumber] ELSE managers END AS managers
WHERE m3 IS NOT NULL

OPTIONAL MATCH (m4:User {employeeNumber: m3.managerid})
WITH e, m4,
     CASE WHEN NOT m4.employeeNumber IN managers THEN managers + [m4.employeeNumber] ELSE managers END AS managers
WHERE m4 IS NOT NULL

// Output the result
RETURN e.employeeNumber AS employeeNumber, 
       e.managerid AS managerid,
       CASE 
           WHEN size(managers) =1 and e.managerid = e.employeeNumber THEN 1 
           WHEN size(managers) =1 and e.managerid <> e.employeeNumber THEN 2
           WHEN size(managers) =2  THEN 3
           WHEN size(managers) =3  THEN 4
           ELSE 0 
       END AS Level,  // Adjust level for CEO
       CASE WHEN size(managers) > 0 THEN managers[0] ELSE NULL END AS L1managerid,
       CASE WHEN size(managers) > 1 THEN managers[1] ELSE NULL END AS L2managerid,
       CASE WHEN size(managers) > 2 THEN managers[2] ELSE NULL END AS L3managerid,
       CASE WHEN size(managers) > 3 THEN managers[3] ELSE NULL END AS L4managerid
ORDER BY e.employeeNumber
