Modify below query in v1 to start from ceo. ceo has managerid same as employeeNumber

MATCH (ceo:User)
WHERE ceo.managerid = ceo.employeeNumber  // CEO condition

// Start from CEO and collect the hierarchy up to 4 levels
WITH ceo AS e, [ceo.employeeNumber] AS managers

// Collect manager hierarchy up to 4 levels, ensuring no duplicates
OPTIONAL MATCH (m:User {employeeNumber: e.managerid})
WITH e, m, 
     CASE WHEN NOT m.employeeNumber IN managers THEN managers + [m.employeeNumber] ELSE managers END AS managers
WHERE m IS NOT NULL

OPTIONAL MATCH (m2:User {employeeNumber: m.managerid})
WITH e, m2,
     CASE WHEN NOT m2.employeeNumber IN managers THEN managers + [m2.employeeNumber] ELSE managers END AS managers
WHERE m2 IS NOT NULL

OPTIONAL MATCH (m3:User {employeeNumber: m2.managerid})
WITH e, m3,  
     CASE WHEN NOT m3.employeeNumber IN managers THEN managers + [m3.employeeNumber] ELSE managers END AS managers
WHERE m3 IS NOT NULL

OPTIONAL MATCH (m4:User {employeeNumber: m3.managerid})
WITH e, m4,
     CASE WHEN NOT m4.employeeNumber IN managers THEN managers + [m4.employeeNumber] ELSE managers END AS managers
WHERE m4 IS NOT NULL

// Output the result
RETURN e.employeeNumber AS employeeNumber, 
       e.managerid AS managerid,
       CASE
