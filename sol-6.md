Got it! You're asking to separate the query into parts, do some processing in between using Pandas (as we discussed earlier), and then put everything together. Let me outline how to structure it:

### Goal:
1. Fetch the necessary data in stages.
2. Process the intermediate data in **Pandas**.
3. Use the processed data to run optimized queries.

Let's break the query into **three parts** and implement the intermediate steps in **Pandas**.

---

### Part 1: **Fetch Users and Manager Structure**

First, we'll get the basic details about the users and their managers without fetching the `Name` and `WorkEmail` attributes yet. This part only collects `employeeNumber` and the `managerid` structure.

```cypher
MATCH (u:User)
WHERE u.managerid IS NOT NULL 
AND ("Employee" IN labels(u) OR "Contractor" IN labels(u))

// Traverse the reporting structure (up to 15 levels)
MATCH (u)-[:REPORTS_TO*1..15]->(m:User)

// Collect manager employee numbers (manager_ids)
WITH u, COLLECT(DISTINCT m.employeeNumber) AS manager_ids

RETURN u.employeeNumber AS employeeid, manager_ids
ORDER BY u.employeeNumber
SKIP {offset} LIMIT {batch_size};
```

#### **Explanation:**
- **Step 1**: We're fetching the `employeeNumber` of the users and collecting their `managerid` (employeeNumber of managers).
- This allows you to work with just the raw `manager_ids` for each user and process them in Pandas.

#### **Pandas Processing**:
Now, you will take this data and use **Pandas** for any transformations, optimizations, or additional logic.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example query result returned by Neo4j
data = [
    {"employeeid": 1001, "manager_ids": [2001, 3001]},
    {"employeeid": 1002, "manager_ids": [2002, 3002, 4001]},
    {"employeeid": 1003, "manager_ids": [2003]},
    # Add more data as needed...
]

# Load data into pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Now, you can process manager_ids and calculate manager levels
# For example, adding the 'Level' column based on the number of managers
def get_level(manager_ids):
    if len(manager_ids) == 1:
        return 1
    elif len(manager_ids) == 2:
        return 2
    # Continue as needed for more levels...
    return 16  # Default if greater than 15

df['Level'] = df['manager_ids'].apply(get_level)

# Now the DataFrame 'df' contains the employeeid and calculated levels.
# You can now prepare for fetching details for these manager_ids.
```

---

### Part 2: **Fetch Manager Details**

Now that we have the unique `manager_ids` from the previous query, we can **optimize** the process by fetching manager details (name and work email) in one go for all relevant `manager_ids`.

```python
# Extract all unique manager ids from the dataframe to use in the next query
unique_manager_ids = df['manager_ids'].explode().unique()

# Format these IDs into a list suitable for the query
manager_ids_str = ', '.join(map(str, unique_manager_ids))

# Now, create the Cypher query to fetch all manager details at once
query = f"""
MATCH (m:User)
WHERE m.employeeNumber IN [{manager_ids_str}]
RETURN m.employeeNumber AS employeeid, m.name AS manager_name, m.workEmail AS manager_email
"""
```

#### **Explanation:**
- This Cypher query now fetches the `manager_name` and `workEmail` for all managers in one go, reducing the number of separate queries.
- The `manager_ids` are dynamically extracted from the `pandas` DataFrame and passed into the Cypher query.

---

### Part 3: **Final Data Merge**

After retrieving manager details in **Pandas**, we can merge the manager data with the user data.

```python
# Example manager data fetched from the Neo4j query
manager_data = [
    {"employeeid": 2001, "manager_name": "John Doe", "manager_email": "john@example.com"},
    {"employeeid": 2002, "manager_name": "Jane Smith", "manager_email": "jane@example.com"},
    # Add more managers...
]

# Load manager details into a DataFrame
manager_df = pd.DataFrame(manager_data)

# Merge the user DataFrame with the manager details on 'employeeid'
final_df = pd.merge(df, manager_df, left_on='manager_ids', right_on='employeeid', how='left')

# Now the final_df contains the employeeid, manager levels, and manager details (name, email)
print(final_df.head())
```

---

### Final Query Flow (Optimized Steps):

1. **Step 1**: Fetch the basic user and manager structure (employee numbers, manager IDs). This is done in a batch for all users.
2. **Step 2**: Use **Pandas** to process the list of `manager_ids` and determine the level for each user.
3. **Step 3**: Extract the **unique manager IDs** and fetch manager details (name and email) in a **single Cypher query**.
4. **Step 4**: Merge the manager details back with the original user data in **Pandas**.

---

### Why This Approach is Better:

- **Efficiency**: Fetching manager data in bulk (using a single `IN` query for all manager IDs) is faster than running multiple separate queries.
- **Batch Processing**: We're fetching user data in manageable batches and doing intermediate processing in **Pandas**, which is more flexible and allows for optimizations.
- **Separation of Concerns**: By separating the querying logic (Cypher) and data processing (Pandas), you gain more control over each part of the process, allowing for future optimizations and easier debugging.

# how the final output will look like?

The final output will contain both the user's employee information and the details of their managers at various levels. Specifically, the result will include the following:

1. **Employee Information**:
   - `employeeid`: The employee’s unique ID (from the `User` node).
   - `Level`: The employee's level based on the number of managers in their reporting hierarchy.

2. **Manager Information**:
   - For each manager level (L1 to L15), we will include:
     - `L1managerid`, `L1managerFirstName`, `L1managerLastName`, `L1managerEmail`: The manager’s ID, first name, last name, and work email at level 1.
     - `L2managerid`, `L2managerFirstName`, `L2managerLastName`, `L2managerEmail`: The manager’s ID, first name, last name, and work email at level 2.
     - This pattern continues for each manager level up to 15.

### Example of the Final Output

Let’s say you have 3 users with the following manager structure:

1. **User 1001** reports to `Manager 2001` and `Manager 3001`.
2. **User 1002** reports to `Manager 2002`, `Manager 3002`, and `Manager 4001`.
3. **User 1003** reports only to `Manager 2003`.

The final output DataFrame after the merge will look like this:

| employeeid | Level | L1managerid | L1managerFirstName | L1managerLastName | L1managerEmail         | L2managerid | L2managerFirstName | L2managerLastName | L2managerEmail        | L3managerid | L3managerFirstName | L3managerLastName | L3managerEmail       |
|------------|-------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 1001       | 2     | 2001        | John               | Doe               | john.doe@example.com    | 3001        | Alice              | Green             | alice.green@example.com| NULL        | NULL               | NULL              | NULL                 |
| 1002       | 3     | 2002        | Jane               | Smith             | jane.smith@example.com  | 3002        | Bob                | Black             | bob.black@example.com | 4001        | Carol              | White             | carol.white@example.com|
| 1003       | 1     | 2003        | Charlie            | Brown             | charlie.brown@example.com| NULL        | NULL               | NULL              | NULL                 | NULL        | NULL               | NULL              | NULL                 |

#### Explanation of Columns:
1. **`employeeid`**: The unique ID of the employee.
2. **`Level`**: The level of the employee based on the number of managers.
   - For example, `User 1001` has 2 managers, so their level is 2.
3. **`L1managerid`, `L1managerFirstName`, `L1managerLastName`, `L1managerEmail`**: The details of the L1 manager. If the employee has no L1 manager, these values will be `NULL`.
4. **`L2managerid`, `L2managerFirstName`, `L2managerLastName`, `L2managerEmail`**: The details of the L2 manager. Again, `NULL` if not available.
5. **Further Levels**: You would continue for `L3` to `L15` in a similar pattern, with each subsequent manager being fetched as part of the hierarchy, but with `NULL` values if there are fewer managers for the employee.

### Example Breakdown:

- **For `User 1001`**:
  - **Level 2**: This employee has two managers, `Manager 2001` and `Manager 3001`.
    - **L1**: Manager 2001 (John Doe)
    - **L2**: Manager 3001 (Alice Green)

- **For `User 1002`**:
  - **Level 3**: This employee has three managers, `Manager 2002`, `Manager 3002`, and `Manager 4001`.
    - **L1**: Manager 2002 (Jane Smith)
    - **L2**: Manager 3002 (Bob Black)
    - **L3**: Manager 4001 (Carol White)

- **For `User 1003`**:
  - **Level 1**: This employee has only one manager, `Manager 2003`.
    - **L1**: Manager 2003 (Charlie Brown)
    - All other levels (L2 to L15) will be `NULL`.

### Considerations:

- **Nulls for Missing Levels**: If an employee doesn't have enough managers in the hierarchy (for example, they report to only one manager), the remaining manager levels (L2 to L15) will be `NULL`.
- **Scalability**: Since you're fetching all manager details in bulk (via a single query for `manager_ids`), this approach ensures that you don't have to make multiple separate queries, which can significantly improve performance when you scale to hundreds of thousands or millions of records.
  
This structure makes the data both human-readable and ready for further analysis or reporting.
